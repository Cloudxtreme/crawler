<br>I have a low re-play score on this game because when you re-play the game (which there is a strong desire to re-play this game to try other choices) the new different choices you make either 1) don&apos;t make much difference and/or 2) the way the main character and other characters act/re-act for non-mainstream choices is highly unrealistic. I really loved this game and would of given it a 9 for my over-all score, but the re-play that I was anxious to try was a real dud and took away from my original experience; thus giving the game an over-all score of 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=3948948">Expand</a></span>

A poignant yet phenomenal finish to an epic game which has set new standards for story telling in videogames.
<br>I really had given up on videogaming after hours of Call of Duty,Medal Of Honor,Assassin&apos;s Creed and craved for something new. This game stunningly surpassed my expectations. I feel it worth mentioning here that i am completely new to point-and-click adventure games,so i was quite skeptical about the idea of a point-and-click adventure game having as much to offer as a fast paced FPS or a thrilling action/adventure game. This game might even seem graphically unappealing to a chunk of gamers but its storyline really overshadows its shortcomings if any. Since its second season will be hitting the shelves soon,i recommend it as a MUST BUY!!!
<br>P.S : If my review seems too exaggerated to some people,i&apos;d recommend a look at the bar above which says &quot;47 positive&quot; and just &quot;1 negative&quot; review.
<br>P.P.S: Telltale Games. you&apos;ve got a new fan :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786222">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The other strong point in the game is the dialogue choice options. Everything you say almost always have some kind of impact in the story, from gaining influence over some pal of your group, to trigger a whole situation that may save your life or kill you. In fact, the difficulty of the game is not killing the zombies, but preventing your group to split or fall into hysteria.
<br>
<br>The only thing that could be better, are the puzzles. For a graphic adventure the puzzles are quite weak, but it kind of compensates with a great dose of action. All crowned with a great and moving ending.
<br>
<br>This game is a must have so try it. You won&apos;t be dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2809687">Expand</a></span>

If the season two maintains this level of quality, we might have a new legendary series in gaming. I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t say anything bad about this episode, it felt like all the technical difficulties weren&apos;t there anymore (or maybe at this point I just didn&apos;t care about them I just wanted to save little Clementine...). Hats of to Telltale for this season of The Walking Dead, it really honors the original comics and beats the TV series in every possible way. I hope it won&apos;t take too long until we get to see what happens next...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780834">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am going to be honest. Until the Walking Dead game series that Telltale has brilliant crafted, I cannot remember the last time I played a point and click adventure game, but I sure am glad I tried it again. Throughout the entire series, I saw my choices have an influence on what happened later in the episode or in later episodes, but never as much as that that is seen in the final episode &quot;No Time Left.&quot; Telltale has successfully created a game that blends a unique art style, wonderful voice acting and a story that is probably the best story you&apos;ll play this entire year to create a series that, I believe, will have an impact on the future story development of video games. After playing through all of the episodes, I can definitely say that this was the most enjoyable episode, previously episode 2. It is such a delight to see how Telltale managed to bring the entire story together. The emotion that is brought out by the story and voice acting is so powerful, I almost cried at certain parts. I don&apos;t want to spoil the ending, but let&apos;s just say I can&apos;t wait for Telltale&apos;s newly announced Season 2. If you haven&apos;t played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to play all of the episodes. Telltale&apos;s series is not perfect, but the way they brought it all together at the end makes you understand why this game should be considered for game of the year. I would give it a 9.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780688">Expand</a></span>

No ending could have been more appropriate for the series and I honestly believe it tops Episode 2. Can&apos;t say much  more without spoiling it, but grab this game as soon as you can. Oh, and tell all your friends about it too. No one should get left out of this one</span>

The bar for story-telling in a game has now been raised so high, I look forward to the one which will surpass it. Hopefully, I wouldn&apos;t have to wait long, and Season 2 comes out soon. A definite first-day purchase for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780830">Expand</a></span>

No big surprises, no drawn out puzzles or even moments of peace to converse with your fellow group members. And the guy behind the radio feels abit out of place after his awkward explanation of who he is and why his doing this.
<br>Theres NO TIME LEFT for much, except for Season 2!

The gameplay was weak even when compared to previous episodes. Often times it was just walking on rails with no exploring at all. 3.) The dialogue options were weak. 4.) The ending was pretty obvious after episode 4 and imo wasn&apos;t all that powerful. I like the overall story but the characters for the most part leave something to be desired. I would like to see a more ingenious, creative character................................................ Now for an overall picture I give the game a 6/10. I agree with some of the negative posters saying the advertising is a little misleading because you do not determine the outcome of anything, there isn&apos;t much exploring which would be great in a game like this, and there aren&apos;t that many choices. It&apos;s not so much the gameplay, which definitely needs to be improved even by telltale standards, as it is the design. It just falls short on several levels including the length of each episode, how your choices don&apos;t matter after a little while, how you seem to have no control over your next action, etc. I think a lot of this fell on budget issues and since this game sold well I am hoping that the sequel will be stronger. I also wish this was released all as one game as it would have been a better experience compared to 5 split episodes over 7 months with each one being of varying quality. I would say for the next one in the series that if the developers can increase the length to 20+ hours with some actual replay value and maybe a few other options I&apos;d buy it for $60. As it stand now it&apos;s really only worth $15 in my opinion (12 hour experience playing very slow with no replay value). So I recommend it if you can get it on sale somewhere around that price (steam holiday sale).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789488">Expand</a></span>

The only thing good about this game is the voice acting, other than that its just another game taking advantages of a succeful franchise .  Dont buy this game , i was tempted when i saw it as top sellers on Steam and now regret my actions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2903271">Expand</a></span>

This wouldn&apos;t be such a bad thing if the game wasn&apos;t marketed as having a unique story where the choices you make alter the game drastically, because they don&apos;t. The story somehow loops back around again to follow a set path shortly after making these so-called game changing decisions.
<br>
<br>Overall I loved the game and the story, but I believe that Telltale could&apos;ve done more with regards to the decision making and the impact it had on gameplay. If I had to rate the game as a whole, all episodes included and without taking into account the poor mechanics previously mentioned, I&apos;d give it a ten, no question. I&apos;m left slightly disappointed though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2782120">Expand</a></span>

I hate zombie games and movies, but this one just let my jaw drop, kicked my ass with emotions, smashed my imagination with a 10-ton blow, and made me yearn form more games with so well-written characters, balanced action, awesome atmosphere, superb dubbing, and engaging storyline. A must-play and the best game of 2012, which proves that even with an old engine and not-so innovative mechanics, games can be mature, enriching and enchanting at the same time. The Walking Dead is bound to become a classic that will be mentioned alongside Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Grim Fandango, Monkey Island, Sanitarium, Broken Sword series, and all the cool adventure games that have been recently relegated to indie-game genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783745">Expand</a></span>

The whole thing felt rushed and there was hardly anything to do and decide (not that decisions would really matter, but still). And despite some good scenes it was pretty much obvious from the end of episode 4 how everything would turn out.
<br>
<br>Maybe it&apos;s just me but I expect more to &quot;do&quot; when I play a computer game and if a company advertises with how much my choices would matter I also expect to be able to actually influence the course and outcome of the story. Small dialogue changes and deciding which tritagonist may survive one episode longer doesn&apos;t really count in my book.
<br>
<br>I really wonder why they bothered making a game out of it in the first place and not just some &quot;normal&quot; animated TV series instead. That would&apos;ve worked just great, but TWD by Telltale fails miserably as an adventure game and even more when compared to what was advertised.
<br>
<br>Good for those who like the game, but I think it falls far behind from it&apos;s potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2788239">Expand</a></span>

The two is for the whole game. All that time waiting and making choices come to find out that no matter what you picked, no matter how many different options you try, you will get the same exact ending, as will the rest of the characters. I was pretty sure that it was a zombie action tale, but no, it is a painstakingly long drug out Soap-Opera with some zombies that spoon feeds you the story by not giving you any game play besides point and click where it tells you to. I will not be purchasing their next trap known as &quot;Season 2&quot; of this. I am not going to wait another ten months for something they said would be done in five months for something that tries to get you emotional but is so badly done that the only emotion I feel is to vomit all over the game for actually waiting for that. This is more proof that companies do not care about their users, just their own profit and how to maximize it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781391">Expand</a></span>

This &quot;sad&quot; ending just completely destroys the only aspect of the game I enjoyed. When the rest of the game is such garbage, the least you could provide the player is a satisfying resolution to the story in which the player feels like what they did throughout the episodes was not for naught, and in the end their efforts would actually result in something. Do not simply kill off every character and then leave the player without a proper resolution to the story. Absolutely disappointing. Not only is the story weighed down with a negative tone, but the entire series is just trash. In a nutshell, the Walking Dead game series is a complete waste of money and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2869141">Expand</a></span>

This is now became my favorite game of all time (or at least favorite story) because of this last episode. At the end of this episode, you can choose to shoot Lee, which I chose. This episode leaves you with the hardest choice of the series, Lee&apos;s last words. &quot;I&apos;ll miss you,&quot; As those last words rolled out of Lee&apos;s tongue I let go all of my tears and sobbed. This game brings you to your knees and I almost couldn&apos;t stand the sadness. The writers are amazing and should win any award possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2788557">Expand</a></span>

<br>The action starts right at the beginning of the episode and never lets up, it may be the shortest episode but it has both the best dialogue and action scenes of the entire series. It&apos;s true that you choices don&apos;t have a huge affect on the overall events of the narrative, but instead they succeed in making every choice feel personal, every choice you make is based on your personal morals and ethics in situations where there is no right answer. it&apos;s without a doubt the best story I&apos;ve every played through in a game, though it&apos;s probably closer to a visual novel than traditional games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2790956">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes the game has it&apos;s flaws: technical errors (had to play the series with shadows turned off despite my more than decent rack) and, as stated by many others, the choices you make don&apos;t change the outcome like some might&apos;ve wished they would. The comic-look is a pure matter of taste, I can understand that some people might not like it, but I do.
<br>
<br>BUT apart from it&apos;s deficiencies this here is something unique and I&apos;m glad there&apos;s gonna be another series. This is not about 20 different endings or alike, it&apos;s about hope and how you&apos;re not to loose it and more importantly pass it on to and raise it in somebody else, especially the young ones.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s GRIPPING by every meaning of the word. And I can&apos;t remember any game that touched and/or moved me like this one, especially no point &apos;n&apos; click adventure.
<br>
<br>I for one don&apos;t think the decisions one makes are pointless. I can&apos;t fight the feeling that many people have gotten so used to seeing people die on the screen (and I mean everywhere: the news, the movies and video-games) it just doesn&apos;t do anything for/with them anymore. I actually felt terrible and sorry for some of the decisions I made and many of the things I&apos;ve seen in this game.
<br>
<br>All in all this game tells a great story with convincing characters and is a stunning, gripping experience. 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2792818">Expand</a></span>

As a &quot;game&quot; it lacks in interactivity (walk here, click this, hit that mostly), very simple to non-existent puzzles, linear and very little roaming/discovery, and a story-line dialogue-choice system that doesn&apos;t make a huge difference to the overall course of the game. If you are a p-and-c fan of say Syberia, Broken Sword, Lost Horizon etc., and looking for good puzzles to work through, this game will disappoint. There&apos;s none of that here, with more focus on the story and dialogue. Gets a 6 for the 10 hour gameplay/story in general, plus 1 for being nice to look at and a better than usual ending (imho anyway). Just as well really, as this last episode is the slowest and weakest of them, and a reason why it is probably not strong enough for a replay for me. An enjoyable experience nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822044">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t liked the fact that, no matter what decisions you make, the game will do what it has to do, but this &quot;decision making&quot; thing it&apos;s in fact, what makes a connection between you and the main character. That&apos;s why it didn&apos;t bothered me at the end.
<br>
<br>The story is excellent, the graphics ain&apos;t bad, the game itself it&apos;s &quot;not bad&quot;, i would give the game a 10 if it was another genre, and maybe if it was more like &quot;a game&quot;.
<br>
<br>I only see this game as an...&quot;interactive animated movie&quot;, not like a real game, but god, it&apos;s totally worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873511">Expand</a></span>

This is the best game I have ever played. Period. This is as close as you can get to perfection: the story, the characters, the atmosphere, the emotions, the moral dilemmas... Telltale have not only demonstrated that they are the masters of point-and-click adventure games, they have demonstrated that this type of game can give an experience as satisfying as any other. Because Telltale has understood what is the foundation of any successful game: the story, the story, the story. You can have fantastic graphics and great game-play mechanics, but none of that matters in the end if the story sucks. Let me just end this review with one last comment. I am really not a particularly sentimental guy, but this game made me shed quite a few tears. I don&apos;t recall that happening with any other video game, and I&apos;m speaking of hundreds of them (yeah, I&apos;ve been around for quite a while...). Needless to say, I hope that Telltale will go on with this series for many more seasons.

All of you need to stop judging it on the ending. I&apos;ll look at the whole level. It has a great opening, but after the boat stolen scene, it starts to unravel a bit. When you see the dead couple, Kenny claims suicide is bad, but if you saved Ben, he pretty much locks himself in a alley with walkers to DIE. WTF? And his other death is clearly rushed. It picks up after the part where Lee is seperated, and I like the Stranger reveal, definatly unexpected. I actually started to sympathise with him, and when I killed him, I shot him out of sympathy. But the end was a mixed bag. It evoked emotion out of me a game never had and still hasn&apos;t. But it made no sense. What was the point of cutting your arm off? It doesn&apos;t matter as you still die. And no matter how bad you are to Clementine, she still cries like a baby when Lee dies. It pulls a ME3, as in your choices don&apos;t matter. A good episode, but disappointing as a finale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-5---no-time-left/user-reviews?user_review_id=3274904">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The final episode of TTG&apos;s Game of the Year, The Walking Dead Season One, is both a nerve-wracking and emotional episode. Yes it&apos;s not full of action and panic events like the other episodes, but the finale just went so well and its tone is perfectly set to really be this game&apos;s finale.</span>
