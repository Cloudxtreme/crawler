Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free &quot;Pros &amp; Cons&quot; section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Lovable characters in a charming setting
<br>+ Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing
<br>+ Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot
<br>+ Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Frequent crashes (both random &amp; reproducible)
<br>- Terrible port that isn&apos;t optimized for modern PCs
<br>- Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX
<br>- An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food &amp; sleep were almost never needed)
<br>- Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable
<br>- Terribly timed and overused QTEs
<br>- Tons of muddy, low-rez textures
<br>- Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes
<br>- A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game
<br>
<br>Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.
<br>
<br>Spoilers below, you have been warned!
<br>
<br>I went into Deadly Premonition expecting &quot;Resident Evil with FBI Agents&quot; and instead received &quot;Shenmu with Zombies&quot;. While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It&apos;s a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale&apos;s attention to detail wasn&apos;t put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat&apos;s SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.
<br>
<br>Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce &quot;supernatural&quot; elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach&apos;s head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don&apos;t know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 &amp; 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.
<br>
<br>All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don&apos;t have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.
<br>
<br>While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with &quot;Previously during the investigation...&quot; segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won&apos;t be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-premonition-the-directors-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=4119422">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Honestly, I don&#x2019;t know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game it&#x2019;s not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadn&#x2019;t discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this I&#x2019;m glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So what&#x2019;s good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and it&#x2019;s easy to see why it&#x2019;s gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. There&#x2019;s no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. There&#x2019;s a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-premonition-the-directors-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=6184876">Expand</a></span>

The story and characters, the strange mechanics, the ugly but charming graphics - it&apos;s an odd, yet wonderful creation. Something you must approach with an open mind to truly appreciate.

Although all  features of the game have varying quality to say the last.  Some of the writing is brilliant, some of it is cringeworthy. The main cutscenes are directed in a fantastic way with great artistic vision but the simple dialogue scenes suck. Some of the music is great and appropriate, especially in story cutscenes, but a lot of tracks are totally out of place. The PC port itself is terrible, however with DPFIX installed and a JoyToKey or xpadder it works with gamepad as well. It&apos;s a very interesting and unique peace of work and can be highly entertaining despite it&apos;s big flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-premonition-the-directors-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3815763">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn&apos;t content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition.
<br>
<br>There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it&apos;s utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.
<br>
<br>Deadly Premonition is all that. It&apos;s impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game. Most people will only shake their heads and it&apos;s like trying to describe a miracle to people who never witnessed one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-premonition-the-directors-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=4239604">Expand</a></span>

I am not that optimistic about upcoming patches that will fix crashes, fps and will add xbox pad support, that&apos;s why I already refunded it... Score is 2 for intriguing intro... will change my score if the game will be patched as it should be and I&apos;d be able to .play it.</span>

It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.
<br>
<br>Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.
<br>
<br>Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.
<br>
<br>This is pretty important; if you don&apos;t do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the &quot;quirky dialogue&quot; as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-premonition-the-directors-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=4919743">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Only issue would be the that the game can be buggy and hard to follow.
<br>
<br>Solid 7/10

Try typing &quot;most polarizing video game of all time&quot; on Google and look at the top results and related searches. Yep.
<br>
<br>If you ever get this PoS to work within the 2-hour refund period, you&apos;ll be greeted by toga-wearing twins spouting gibberish, crime-related references to The Tom and Jerry show, and squirrels purposefully given the sound bytes of a startled chimpanzee. After a fatal car crash and one unhurt protagonist crawling out of a burning car, full of swagger on his back, you get to play the top contender for worst Dreamcast game ever. Outdated control scheme, horrendous graphics, and gameplay mechanics that borrowed from the worst inspirations ever; it&apos;s like this game was stuck in development for over a decade. Oh wait, it was.[www.polygon.com]
<br>
<br>But even with all the trash found in the game, I still admired it. After playing it through to the end, I respected it. I&apos;ll even admit that I became teary-eyed once the game showed its final scenes. It was the story, with all its surreal moments and weird but charming cast that kept me playing and invested in the game. Deadly Premonition is a homage to Twin Peaks, a show that inspired video games like Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Silent Hill. A show that ended too soon, yet the concept found new life in video games. It&apos;s how game writer and director Hidetaka Suehiro molded the Lynchian framework into something more akin to his style, while still respecting the inspiration, that made the game shine. This is art, plain and simple. And no word has ever been more fitting for the most polarizing video game of all time.

<br>- From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There&apos;re not many open world survival horror games like this out there.
<br>- Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D
<br>- Let&apos;s talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it&apos;s scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player &quot;go there!...is funny isn&apos;t it!?&quot; for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000&apos;s but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that&apos;s my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time!
<br>- The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP).
<br>- The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it.
<br>- OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a &quot;pro&quot; but is not a &quot;con&quot;).
<br>- The OST is amazing! Point mother &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing period!
<br>- The Director&apos;s Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now).
<br>- Also the Director&apos;s Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding.
<br>- If you didn&apos;t get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.
<br>- &quot;DP Fix&quot; exist! (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438) As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;)
<br>Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let&apos;s to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Even with a monster PC you&apos;ll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT.
<br>- You can loose some interesting character development if you don&apos;t explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>- You can find &quot;Pillow Stains&quot;, the song from the former form of DP called &quot;Rainny Woods&quot; check the trailer on YouTube: https://youtu.be/EbbhwO7pRHA within the game ;) just explore the map. Song: https://youtu.be/H9zfSVmMbjM
<br>
<br>- Don&apos;t waste your first playthrough without doing side-quest.
<br>- DP Fix recommendations:
<br>1) Desactivare the DEP for the .exe
<br>2) Create a shortcut of the .exe to achieve the borderless mode.
<br>3) Run the .exe with W98 compatibility and admin rights.
<br>4) If you have some .dll problems just follow the Steam discussions. Every OS is different.
<br>5) You can now use Sweet FX to bring the Xbox 360 grading.
<br>6) There&apos;s a horrible Memory Leak problem within the fullscreen mode. Use borderless as mentioned before to solve this on many cases. This also will solve the issue of the Alt+Tab freeze and the steam overlay.
<br>Many other issues and workarounds can be found here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director&apos;s_Cut
<br>- I would add many things but they could be spoilers. I would recommend you to visit my friend Whitney&apos;s Page &quot;Welcome to Greenvale&quot; www.facebook.com/welcometogreenvale and her YouTube: www.youtube.com/user/shhistoricalsociety
