Well there&apos;s definitely some throwbacks to the &quot;classics&quot; (for me0 at least) of cRPGs, the Fallouts, Arcanum and so on, but the game really stands on it own and feels really different to the classics not to mention the more modern RPG fare.
<br>
<br>The character system is made up of different attributes and a smattering of skills. The skills are divided between social skills and combat skills. You also get to pick a background for your character which determines your starting point in the story. All this enables some deep and rewarding choices right of the bat. Speaking of which, I really love the character creation screen. It is a thing of beauty. No clunky toggling between menus or endless scrolling in lists (I&apos;m looking at you Bethesda), just all the information you need right there in front of your eyes.
<br>
<br>The combat is made up of a tactical and rewarding turn-based system with a wide range of possible builds (I&apos;ve been having fun playing an Assassin focused on throwing weapons and poisons) as well as challenging AI. The fights are scripted and there is (thank god) no grinding or random encounters, the hand crafting of the fights really make some of them stand out, and almost none are boring or routine especially if you are trying to steer your skill points away from the combat skills to the social skills to see a different side of the story and setting. Easily my favorite combat system in a long time!
<br>
<br>The game is really heavy on choices and consequences, and the game reacts to your activities in a lot of different ways. Some choices closes of parts of the story but a door is seldom closed without a window being opened. You can change your loyalties if and when it makes sense but don&apos;t be surprised if it comes back and bites you in some way later. Another part of this is the abundance of skill and attribute checks throughout the game. One character really can&apos;t do everything. I&apos;ve started a half dozen characters soon and I&apos;m still not satisfied that I&apos;ve seen everything cool in the game.
<br>
<br>The graphics are serviceable, but the art direction and presentation are quite good, as is the music. The game is a bit lacking in ambient sounds but for me that&apos;s no big deal. All in all the graphics side of things ranges from fine to quite good. Not the focus of the game, clearly.
<br>
<br>The writing and quests are excellent and really makes sense in the context of the setting. I&apos;m actually blown away by some of the descriptions of situations you find yourself in. Almost all of the quest feature some amount of branching (most an impressive amount!) and alternative solutions depending on your skills. Though beware, not all characters will be able to pick and choose their path freely, see what solutions makes sense with your skill selection! All in all the second best part of the game for me was the writing.
<br>
<br>Before I finish, a short interlude on my take on Early access.
<br>
<br>I actually bought the a couple of years back while it was still in Early Access. This is a first for me, I play a fair amount of games but I try not to get too caught up in the hype and buying an unfinished product is something I rarely do. But here&apos;s the deal: I really love RPGs, especially RPGs of the &quot;old school&quot;-variety and, since I want to keep seeing them being made, I bought the game to show my support. It doesn&apos;t hurt that the hefty demo is more than enough to see if you will like the game play offered. So, if you like the sound of this: try the demo and if you have fun, buy the game so we can have more nice things!
<br>
<br>Since I got the game I&apos;ve been trying to stay away from it, partly because I didn&apos;t want to spoil myself, partly because the development time was unbearably long. But since release I just can&apos;t stop playing, this game is a clear joy to play and I&apos;m really impressed with the developers have accomplished!

This was *hard* or at least the first half of the game, hard in a challenging way. &quot;Isn&apos;t it bad that you restarted 9 times?&quot; Glad that you asked, it wasn&apos;t. I was pretty depressed that i couldn&apos;t win certain fights, but after carefully arranging my stats and the kill order, it worked, like magic. I am a number cruncher anyway and the power gamer in me wanted that cookie cutter build that would work for me as a fighter. And what a beast my Brutus was ... Now that I got that out of my system, I can play as a talker, and I can confirm that the game play experience if *significantly* different. it&apos;s like 3 games in one, where every archetype gets a different gaming experience. I don&apos;t mean just the first 2 hours, I mean half the game! For hardcore RPG fans AoD is a must play.

<br>The game is pretty ugly by today standard, the camera is sluggish, there&apos;s way too much rng in fights, the story is short and some parts of it may seem unfinished. Apart from that it&apos;s a pretty good old school cRpg.
<br>
<br>That was my mind after my first playthrough, but the (very active) dev keeps telling the real value of the game is in replayability. The game being somewhat pleasant I gave it a try and.... OMG ! I missed entire parts of the game in my first playthrough, and I missed some in my second, and even in my third...
<br>
<br>Three playthrough, a forth well in his way, I always learn something about the game, I keep discovering new locations, the story is never the same and change with every important choice.... choice you can or can not do based on your character abilities, and so how you actually play it !
<br>
<br>Want to be a killing machine  ? No problem, a killing machine you will be, and you will be feared ! But do not expect to understand a lot about the world and political interests... You might prefer to be a cleaver merchant, an historian, a thief... Will you work for your guild or betray them for another one ? will you faithfully serve your lord ? And how ?
<br>All in all, the new religion rising needs a new prophet, why could you not be it ?
<br>
<br>The Age of Decadence it&apos;s all that and more, a game you can finish without doing a lone fight, or on the contrary you can fight all through the entire game. What will you do is up to you, you have a solid background to play with, a very adaptive story and your choices do matter a lot in the end, have fun ! Oh and if you hesitate, there&apos;s a free demo to try !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5641268">Expand</a></span>

The days before dumbed down shooters became all the rage. A true must own for any hardcore RPG fan.
<br>
<br>Plot:
<br>The game is set in an alternate world, where a Roman-esque empire had mastered magic. The details have been lost to history, but apparently there was some sort of war that left the world in ruins.  Now, hundreds of years later, modern leaders/robber barons have each set up their own little kingdoms and are vying for control over the remnants of the known world, like dogs over scraps.
<br>
<br>The game is well written and filled with ancient secrets, plots, and intrigue - which the player may either ignore or participate in, but it will affect the game regardless. Choosing to help someone be named Emperor could cause someone else to panic and make drastic decisions. Choosing to do nothing might allow certain factions to gain more control than they would have had you intervened. Everything is connected and each choice you make or don&apos;t make will probably have some repercussions down the line. It feels really good to make choices that matter and aren&apos;t just window dressing.
<br>
<br>Overall Gameplay:
<br>Gameplay in this game is LARGELY based upon which skills you pick and which choices you make. A stealthy assassin working for the assassin&apos;s guild is going to meet different people and fight different battles than the cunning grifter who gets by on lies and deception.  The streetwise thief is less likely to be taken in by the lies of others than a gullible mercenary.
<br>
<br>Dialog itself might well be considered its own gameplay.  Dialog is affected by your skills, but just because your skills give you an option doesn&apos;t mean that option is a generic &quot;win button&quot;.  In fact, different skills will open legitimately different paths and sometimes, a combination of skills are needed in order to achieve a certain outcome.
<br>
<br>The game has multiple endings depending on your choices, so it really is almost as if there are several different games worth of content - and odds are that you won&apos;t be able to see all the content in one play-through, so multiple play-throughs are both recommended and enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>For those of you waiting for a hardcore turn-based RPG that doesn&apos;t pull its punches, the past decade and a half has been full of mixed blessings and downright disappointments.  Fans of the original Fallout&apos;s gameplay were told that Fallout&apos;s combat was &quot;outdated&quot; and Fallout 3 became a yet another shooter with RPG elements. Even the as early as 1999 Baldur&apos;s Gate and the infinity engine games gave us real-time with pause gameplay in lieu of actual turn-based gameplay - again with the excuse that turn-based games just wouldn&apos;t sell. Well, not Age of Decadence. From day one they&apos;ve stuck to making a turn-based game for turn-based enthusiasts and they have succeeded brilliantly.
<br>
<br>Combat is challenging, varied and - with the right skills and gameplay choices - completely optional. The game is single player, so it&apos;s similar to Fallout 1 &amp; 2&apos;s turn-based gameplay - albeit with a variety of different moves and items you can use. For example, a fast attack will hit accurately, while a regular attack or a power attack will each do more damage, but be less likely to hit. You can attack multiple enemies at once with a whirlwind attack, or attack arms or legs to either trip your enemy or make them drop their weapon. Also, you can poison your weapons, use ranged weapons, throw nets, bombs or even acid. Different weapons have different options. A spear, for instance, can interrupt an enemy and hit him before he can approach you to attack. A dagger can strike faster and more often than a sword, but a big axe or a spear can strike diagonally. Because of these many options, combat can be just as much about good strategy as it is about stats.
<br>
<br>There are no trash mobs, no rooms full of random enemies whose sole purpose is to slow you down and make the game longer. Each combat encounter is hand-designed and comes about due to the choices the player makes.  Were you tricked into following the wrong sort of person into a dark alley? Well, enjoy the fight.  Did you murder an Imperial guardsman? Well, his friends are going to want some payback.  Did you tell the leader of an enemy army to stick his head between his legs and kiss his own rear end? You get the picture.
<br>
<br>Overall I have to say I haven&apos;t played a game with this many choices and consequences in a long while. The fact that it has challenging combat is a welcome bonus, though many have said it&apos;s too hard.
<br>
<br>So the question is: should you buy this game? Well, if you want your hand held, want to be guaranteed success and don&apos;t like reading, I suggest you wait until you are a bit older. To the rest of us who remember an era before player characters would magically resurrect at the end of every battle, before quest compasses let us play the game on auto-pilot, before &quot;combat&quot; meant mashing buttons: I say, welcome home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5556084">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Consistent with the old-school design philosophy - of not treating the player as an idiot, with little-to-none hand-holding, the game gives you a multitude of skills, backgrounds and approaches to fiddle with.
<br>It&apos;s very easy to get into (if you&apos;re not afraid to fail), but hard to master.
<br>
<br>When a typical RPG gives you options, consequences are usually shown as flavor text, a side-quest or two, or even maybe an additional ending (or a romance!), but in Age of Decadence choice is everything.
<br>In AoD the typical framework of choice &amp; consequence is &quot;upside down&quot; - some SIDE quests will be present in multiple playthroughs while the MAIN path will be completely different each time! (if you choose different starting background/skills)
<br>
<br>It all means that:
<br>- Experimenting heavily with your character build (and seeing the effects) is possible, even necessary.
<br>- You won&apos;t see all of the options in a single playthrough.
<br>- Some unique areas won&apos;t be accessible to you in each game.
<br>See that old and strange architecture? There&apos;s an ancient mechanism to interact with? Soooo, you&apos;re an expert in ancient stuff? No? Then carry on, and do whatever YOUR character does best. You can always go back to the strange place with different character and see where it takes you from there.
<br>
<br>I admit, it can be frustrating playing this type of game if you don&apos;t agree with said design decisions (kind-of strict - &quot;Play it our way&quot; design), BUT if you try - just for few hours, to play the way it&apos;s meant to be played, you&apos;&apos;ll see that there&apos;s still a lot of room for rewarding choice in that framework - besides character creation.
<br>
<br>Technical stuff: good SFX, so-so graphics (but with great art direction), no voiceover, great writing (better than any and all AAA titles) and almost bug-free at release (almost impossible with complex choice-based RPGs).
<br>
<br>One thing about writing (which is great). If you like RPGs, but you&apos;re afraid of walls of unnecessary text - have no fear about AoD. Yes the game IS text/dialogue heavy, but in contrast to Pillars of Eternity or latest Shadowrun game - there&apos;s no junk text. You won&apos;t have to read pages and pages of wordy but useless descriptions of unimportant characters.
<br>Of course its the player who decides what&apos;s important and what&apos;s not, but i think the Devs did a great job here of balancing the ratio of flavor text/important info.
<br>
<br>Curiosity and story drives you forward in AoD, and NOT the promise of being a hero, nor fighting the Big Bad Boss&#x2122; - defeating whom is usually underwhelming and unsatisfying experience in video games. (&quot;You did it? Wow, here&apos;s a medal. Go wait for a sequel.&quot;)
<br>
<br>This &quot;you&apos;re-not-a-hero&quot; design is visible everywhere in the game, and the Devs clearly have their own and specific anwser to &quot;what makes Games satisfying&quot; question.
<br>
<br>If you agree with their approach, you&apos;ll love Age of Decadence.
<br>If not, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll learn to love it. I personally think it&apos;s worth trying no matter what games you enjoy.
<br>I suggest throwing away your preconceptions about RPGs and games in general, and just trying AoD for what it is. You will, most probably, be pleasantly surprised.
<br>
<br>So try it (there&apos;s a demo), or even better - buy it if you enjoy complex games that entertain your intelligence and imagination. You&apos;ll support ambitious developers trying something fresh, bringing to the table specific, and sadly - rare in our times, design philosophy.
<br>
<br>The world in AoD is your oyster. The oyster is dirty, jagged and deadly and can swallow you whole. But deep inside there&apos;s a pearl so big and so beautiful, that even limbless and dying you&apos;ll dream of seeing it just one more time, in it&apos;s full glory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547103">Expand</a></span>

And even though you won&apos;t slay a dragon here the things you can do are way more memorable to me than any fight in Baldur&apos;s Gate for example. You can experience it quite early by playing as an assassin - the last mission in Teron is just superb. In Maadoran and Ganezzar there are even more epic things you can do (don&apos;t want to spoil it by giving specifics).
<br>
<br>But the real strength of Age of Decadence lies in its writing and combat. Quests are memorable and fresh (no fetch quests here, well maybe with one exception that has a hilarious twist at the end), characters seem to be made from flesh and blood (in my top 10 of most memorable characters in any game Age of Decadence would take most of the spots) and the plot is exquisite but to learn all the pieces you have to play for every guild. Which reminds me, I don&apos;t know another game that allows to see the same events from a different POV. Now that is awesome! What&apos;s more, combat is one of the best I&apos;ve seen in any cRPG - even though you have less weapons than in Fallout 2 you can do so much more with them.
<br>
<br>I first learned about this game about a year after I registered on the Codex but didn&apos;t think much about it then. Only after Teron demo had been released the game got my attention. My first impression was bad - ugly looking (or so I thought at the time, I immediately forgot about aesthetics and presentation, the game was so absorbing that I forgot I have to eat or work ;P) game that only has one town (in a demo). Oh, boy was I wrong. This game has soul that most contemporary games lack. The setting is one of the best if not the best ones ever created, the characters feel alive and are brutally realistic and the quests are exquisite.
<br>
<br>There are no fillers here, no copy-pasting and no bloat. You can&apos;t grind here either because every fight is meaningful and there are no trash mobs. In fact, quite often it&apos;s more advantageous to skip a fight and skill points because the price is too big to pay, e.g. by making enemies of a powerful faction your options are limited and in the end you get less skill points. Now that&apos;s truly unique way of making cRPGs. Usually you&apos;re a leader of a fearless party that fears nothing - and I mean nothing, be it a dragon or Jewish condominium. Who in his right mind would flee from a fight right? You&apos;re after all destined to become a demi-god that can destroy a whole town if you wish so even though a while earlier you had problems with rats or goblins. Well, not in in Age of Decadence.
<br>
<br>Oh, and I said at the beginning that this game looks ugly - it&apos;s anything but. Locations are varied and some of them look amazing while the rest is decent at least. In fact I&apos;ve never had immersion breaking, contrary to Fallout new Vegas for example (characters there look terrible and their mimics can give a headache, not to mention bugs and copy-pasted locations).
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>1) Story being presented from different perspectives and different POVs. I don&apos;t remember anything like it in any other game which raises its value even further. Something fresh for a change instead of another &quot;chosen one rescuing the world and fighting the dragons&quot;.
<br>
<br>2) Combat. It actually is enjoyable and makes me want to fight instead of mindlessly left clicking on everything that moves (or sends something that moves). The challenge makes it rewarding once you win whereas in most of other RPGs you can defeat almost anyone with **** stats and quick-save-&gt;quick-load strategy. In AoD there isn&apos;t a universal strategy for every fight. E.g. when fighting a fast and agile opponent that had very high dodge stats using a smaller but faster weapon was more wise (as it should be). You would never hit him with a big hammer but you would hit him with a small one and since he was so agile thanks to practically no armour it was enough to defeat him.
<br>
<br>3) Replayability and Choices and Consequences. They actually do matter and you can never do every quest in every possible way without replaying the game. And that is a good thing IMO. In Fallout New Vegas for example I did practically every quest there was, investing in speech at first since I knew that I could open safes or hack into computers later. For some reason no one would do it before me. Well, not in AoD. If you won&apos;t do quests in Teron someone else will and you can&apos;t go back for them. Which makes sense and which makes me want to replay the game. I don&apos;t want to replay F:NV though since I&apos;ve done everything there was to be done and walking for hours was tedious (BTW, that&apos;s why I like teleporting, although I won&apos;t make a point about it).
<br>
<br>Cons: None, even graphics are fitting and pleasant to the eye.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547474">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was sceptical at first, due to old graphics (which aren&apos;t bad and are actually beautiful in its own way, especially locations and more distinctive opponents) but this game surprised me on every step. I haven&apos;t experienced anything like that in any other RPG, this game is so unique and what&apos;s more important, enjoyable that any shortcomings that it has (camera rotation could be better and sometimes it&apos;s a text adventure but that shouldn&apos;t be a problem for someone who likes to read) become insignificant.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+Superb setting that&apos;s as interesting as World of Darkness, Arcanum or Fallout world.
<br>+VERY interesting quests (no fetch quests here, no grinding either, everything is cream of a crop and there are no fillers here)
<br>
<br>+Great dialogues and characters written with humour and wittiness.
<br>
<br>+Many, many options to solve problems
<br>
<br>+Tactical combat that is challenging and logical but fun (assuming you have a triple digit IQ)
<br>
<br>+Pleasant music
<br>
<br>+Hilarious twists and top notch dark humour
<br>
<br>+Massive choices and consequences.
<br>
<br>+Paradoxically this game&apos;s world is more alive than in any other cRPG. You won&apos;t see weather changing or day becoming night and vice versa and most NPCs are static but with your every action they react to you and the town can change due to your meddling. Awesome.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Camera could be better (but it&apos;s not annoying so I don&apos;t see the point of lowering my score)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5549250">Expand</a></span>

No, there are a lot of things that could be better and so on. But all those things are insignificant to what Age of Decadence does.
<br>I knew Age of Decadence probably will be good RPG, i omitted early access because i didn&apos;t want to destroy my fun playing unfinished game. What surprised me was that Age of Decadence simply took my expectations and run away with them.
<br>
<br>So to start. I think Age of Decadence is imo game that should be classified with Mask of the Betrayer and Planescape: Torment. After finishing it, feeling i got is essentially like those games. Here story is main focus. Difference though is that in both Planescape and MotB there was central story you followed but in AoD there isn&apos;t one. AoD gives something much more important. True Role-Playing. Game doesn&apos;t pigeon hole you to one story you should follow. Game instead gives you every tool you can wield to shape your character and your future. Unlike Planescape and MotB game doesn&apos;t give you fake &quot;discoveries&quot; to make. In those games almost everything is set for you to uncover it. In AoD literally everything is for you to explore and to know and game doesn&apos;t set you on linear journey in which you will see most of the things. You can learn of secrets, rumors, events and so on and only you can verify them. Every-time you delve into some event you have this feeling that what you did is not the end and there is something more under it. This sense of unknown is what both PST and MotB didn&apos;t have and why AoD is just so awesome in that aspect.
<br>
<br>Unlike most of RPGs AoD delivers trully RPG aka Role Playing game. AoD campaign outshines even PnP RPGs in amout of options you can choose and play. Even if you would have best game master i bet 100$ he wouldn&apos;t be able to accommodate to so many options game gives. More that that we are not talking here about just C&amp;C, we are talking here about THE C&amp;C. There is like **** ton of choices in in AoD that completely changes things and world in game. My only minor complain is that almost all C&amp;C don&apos;t have hidden consequences that can bite you in ass later in game (from my play trough though), usually if you have to choose something outcomes are usually short lasting and predictable.
<br>
<br>I absolutely love how game handles events. When you do something you usually are taken to scene of event instead of trekking whole city to it. This disallows preparing for combat events and you usually start in place designer wanted not where you wanted it.
<br>
<br>Story itself is fascinating. I really really really liked it. Which is achievement itself when you consider just how different one playthrough can be. I don&apos;t want to spoil anything but my character was combat oriented and story by end of it really really got interesting despite fact that i played basically murder machine with head count something above 60. Ending i got felt just right to what i did in game. It wasn&apos;t grand or amazing. It just fit my character well.
<br>
<br>This is the benchmark all role playing games will be compared to from now on.
<br>
<br>I really wish game had 2D background. Listening to this small but amazing OST really sets the tone and i feel 2D handpainted backgrounds would really really make game a lot better.
<br>
<br>I played in my playtrough as combat oriented character (literally 10ns in almost all physical skills) and i can safely say combat is really really really amazing. It is not the complexity of it but scenarios in which you fight that makes it. Always outnumbered, always trying to scrape barrel for that one right slash. It really gives you options to handle differently events in game. I often had to replay and change my tactics because something that worked for X didn&apos;t work for Y. You may not believe it but i think this gme has the most balanced combat model ever and despite that it is still fun and allows for bad rolls.
<br>
<br>Game is short but i think being short is big plus here. I finished my playtrough in ~15 hours but that time may wary probably on build you use and choices you make. Ending i got (which i wanted) was really easy to do and there were other things to do, to get different ending which could extend game. Either way game main focus is replay-ability, if game would be something like 50 hours you wouldn&apos;t replay it a lot and game literally gives you every now and then huge C&amp;C that can completely change focus of your story. So most fun from game is those replays, to see things unfolding differently or from different points of view.
<br>
<br>When i finished The Witcher 3 this year i thought RPG of the year was already set. I think now it is safe to say that AoD is easily the best RPG of the year. It is the benchmark we will be using for years or decades and i really really really want to see AoD2. Best of all each playtrough can be completely different. Loremaster will have different starts, events and endings than mercenary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5565421">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a Game of Thrones of video games. I strongly recommend this game to every fan of smart RPGs. If you like date sims like Dragon Age: Inquisition - just go away.

<br>
<br>The game has a number of features which set it apart from most RPG releases in recent years. To name a few such traits, I must refer to the realistic attitudes, motivations and interactions shown by its character cast and in its worldbuilding, the turn-based combat system with a heavy emphasis on tactics, which yet remains surprisingly intuitive, or to the mind-boggling variety of outcomes of its main story and secondary quests. AoD is truly an exceptional occurrence in the recent history of role-playing games.
<br>
<br>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic antiquity, depicting a world not all that different from how people of the Roman Empire probably used to perceive it in the days of the great Barbarian Invasions of IV-VI centuries. The setting is not strictly historical though, so expect partial &quot;contaminations&quot; and amalgamations of Roman era with Ancient Middle East and fantasy themes adapted to those two ingredients of the setting.
<br>
<br>Whereas other games ask for fast reflexes or perseverance in mouse button clicking, good old-fashioned common sense will be the main requirement that AoD poses of you as a player. This may seem like it goes without mention, but really, in this game &quot;think before you act&quot; is your guiding principle, along with &quot;save your game often&quot;. Whether it&apos;s about an ingame decision - like fighting a group of six armed-to-the-teeth thugs - or about your long term strategy in character-building - like spreading his character&apos;s skillpoints too thin over too many unrelated skills, being realistic about your character&apos;s capabilities is what will keep you alive. Putting yourself in your character&apos;s shoes, circumventing his limitations instead of playing superman - isn&apos;t this what role-playing is fundamentally about?
<br>
<br>With realism being a chief design principle, building your character should be done with thought as to which skills will complement each other best. The two ends of the continuum are a pure fighter or a pure diplomat, but a player would rarely settle with a character concentrated solely on combat or on talking. In the majority of cases, your character will end up somewhere in between.
<br>
<br>There is a lot of depth to AoD&apos;s combat, with weapons split into groups where increasing your skill with one weapon in a group provides synergic effect to your skill with other weapons of the same group. To add to that, the same weapons can execute different types of strikes, or be used to strike at different body parts, with varying action point cost and to-hit chance. The end result is that switching from one weapon to another, or from a single weapon to weapon and shield, coupled with changes to the types of strikes you will preform with that weapon, can dramatically alter the course of combat, without any changes to your skill levels with the given weapon.
<br>
<br>Age of Decadence is unlike any other RPG you&apos;ve played in that it will play out differently every time you replay it, depending on your character&apos;s background and skills distribution. The developers at Iron Tower Studios have spent a stupefying 10 years in mostly filling up the game with branches of the main and secondary quests, and with branches of the branches. Reactivity in an RPG can never be too much, and in AoD it reaches a point where the world begins to feel more real and alive than you are used to, especially if you have an affinity for its down-to-earth hardboiled novel-like writing style.
<br>
<br>Age of Decadence is an RPG done right. The game combines great writing and storytelling with branching storylines more complex than anything you&apos;ve seen in a computer game. It boasts a perfectly balanced turn-based combat system and deep classless skills-based character creation and development system. What makes the game stand out among the titles of recent years (and decades) is how the quality exectuion of its systems results in you playing an RPG in the way it&apos;s meant to be played - looking at the world through the eyes of your character, walking the dusty streets in your character&apos;s own sandals.
<br>
<br>I can say without a doubt - AoD is a classic that just got released. I urge you to buy it and play it now, so that by the time the mainstream becomes alert and also proclaims it a classic, you will be ready to boast about how many times you finished it &quot;before it was cool&quot;. And since the game is indie,it has the added benefit of being relatively cheap, so for the price of a triple-A game, you can buy two copies of AoD and gift one to a friend, who would later thank you for showing him the game.
<br>
<br>With all this said, really, what could be better...? I&apos;d say Age of Decadence II, hopefully.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5568027">Expand</a></span>

Anyone claiming it is, needs a sanity check. Fallout was engaging from minute 1, has a much more interesting story, better itemization, and most importantly, it was incredibly fun due to when it was released. It was innovative and fresh. It also had a much better combat system with more options and strategy (thanks to perks and skills). This is not Fallout... it is not Baldurs Gate, NWN or even Diablo.
<br>
<br>Three things kill this game.
<br>
<br>#1 Heavy Random number generator (RNG) combat dependency. It sucks. Period. All combat in the 1st town of the game put you at the mercy of the RNG. This is not fun. When you win it does not feel like you won due to strategy or skill. I know that many attribute this to old style gaming back when we had dice, but that was a limitation of the time (pre-video gaming and computers). Yes you can skip the fights, but if you do that you might as well not be playing a video game. Fighting and strategy in a fight is fun. Skipping them and giving us a paragraph explaining what happened is not fun. Okay so make a fighting character you say? Yes, and even if you do, you will lose a lot of fights due to bad luck hence you have to use a lot of cheese to win which is boring. I can take a character built just for fighting and he will still lose to some homeless near naked thugs if they roll lucky. This problem does start to go away once your character gains more skill points but it is not fun in the 1st 5 hours (or so) of the game.
<br>
<br>#2 The need to meta-game kills the immersion. The 1st play through is fine (if you simply dont think about meta-gaming) and makes you want to replay the game to see where alternative paths lead but in order to succeed at many quests and unlock paths you need knowledge that cannot be gained without meta-gaming and that is just boring and not fun at all. The game encourages the player to hoard skill points and quick save before every encounter and interaction to insure that they can pass some sort of skill check. If not, reload, allocate points, and continue. So basically, one second you cannot even spell the word actor (because you never allocated points to impersonation) and the next you are Marlon Brando because you allocated 40 points to the skill. Hence, destroys all immersion.
<br>
<br>#3 Its boring... characterization in this game is very very very weak. It reads like a history book and everyone just seems distant and... dead. There is not enough interpersonal dialog to make you care about your own character or any other character in the game. This makes the story a bit weak as well since I didnt care one way or another what happens.
<br>
<br>The game can be described as late 90s infinity engine throwback combined with older early 90s DnD games like Champions of Krynn. However where the infinity engine games shined was in story and character development and unfortunately, this game is very weak on that front.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the fact that this game encourages the player to think deeply about their character build. Those skill points at creation really do matter as does your skill allocation. However this is no where near as deep as Neverwinter Nights. Also, this game becomes very linear once your allocations are made and there is little wiggle room throughout a play through to change or adjust. Most of the old classics gave you lots of room to customize but in this game once you start on a path there is no deviation or you will be severely handicapped. Again, this is not fun and makes the game feel much more linear than it really is. Your only other option is to do another play through which is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. The greatest games of the infinity engine era did not require multiple replays to fully enjoy the game and since most had more than 1 controllable character, you were able to do most quests and solve most puzzles without having to do the whole game over again. In some ways, this game tries to be like Diablo but does not do a good job of it because it is not an itemization game and you cannot carry over your character to multiple games to improve on them.
<br>
<br>Despite my harsh criticisms of this game, I found myself actually enjoying the 1st run of the game but the RNG thing was a huge letdown in the 1st parts of the game. The meta-gaming flaws really didnt pop out until I tried to run through the game for the 2nd to n-th time and I realized it really is not that much fun to play more than once because I was just meta-gaming and cheesing my way through the game.
<br>
<br>The game is slightly below average. Since 5 is basically average on this site, I would say that this is far below average with the caveat that I see a lot of potential here. This game however is not my cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5570655">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is better than Fallout 1 and 2. It&apos;s better than Arcanum. Better than Planescape. But I only realized that for sure after my second playthrough. That&apos;s when you really see all the different possibilities The Age of Decadence has in store for you.

<br>+ haven&apos;t encounter any bugs so far (2nd playthrough)
<br>+ intuitive controls (not a console port) and UI (fits game&apos;s atmosphere, not smartphone app)
<br>
<br>- sometimes i wish there were less &quot;cutscenes&quot; and more actual gameplay: it&apos;s described your char is going up on the roof - i&apos;d rather do it myself instead of... reading/watching it - i know it&apos;s probably game design limitation, but i cannot ignore it. a flaw is a flaw
<br>
<br>Will buy friends &amp; family for Christmas, worth every penny, only if to encourage Iron Tower Studio to produce more marvels like that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5821628">Expand</a></span>

Not every approach will succeed. So the game is somewhat linear and restraining compared to other modern RPG&apos;s.

<br>If your not that into graphics and wanna feel how games used to be, this is a 100% buy. Even if you&apos;re a casual player this might be interesting and rewarding as long as you keep away from hybrid builds.

<br>
<br>the story is awesome imo, i wouldnt like to spoil anything, so im just going to leave it at that. there are a really impressive amount of endings. any action you take will most likely effect the game somehow, or makes you get a different ending. on your first playthrough, you might be underwhelmed, since its rather hard if not impossible to unlock all the content with one playthrough especially for the first time. its probably the rpg with the most replayability i have ever played. each different character you make will have a different outcome in the situations you encounter based on your skills and attitude.
<br>
<br>i also liked the combat system. it will be hard if you are not familiar with the same type of turn based strategies. it will be even a bit hard if you are, but once you get the feel of it it will be challenging but rewarding also. most aspects of it will include rng, so dont be shy with the savescumming. if you plan to do combat, you will die a few times. just remember. you are not a demigod...yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5795769">Expand</a></span>

For this year I think it will be RPG of the year for me. Even Witcher 3 on second place.
<br>
<br>10 from 10 because:
<br>0. Story have very much sense. It is struggling world after fall of the Empire. Intrigues, plots, murders - part of this world. Not every good deed is rewarded, but almost all bad deeds - do, if you was smart ofcourse. Sometimes NPC trick you and can kill you or they just use you. It is brilliant. Why not all RPGs like that?
<br>1. Good and different story for every fraction. And game have 7 fractions! + side quests + few endings.
<br>2. Your choice really matters. Often it will kill you because you was stupid.
<br>3. Good char system. You cannot be godlike fighter and very good in other things at the same time. You must choose. Still you can finish almost every quest with almost any build if you make hybrid char but game will be much harder (and much more interesting)
<br>4. Hard and interesting turn-based fights and combat system. Alchemy and crafting really matters in many cases.
<br>5. Replayability. Its huge. Every fraction have unique story in same cities. And you choices in first city can change all game.
<br>
<br>All that is make this game very cool.
<br>It have flaws too. For me they didn&apos;t matter very much. Thats why I still give that game 10 from 10. But maybe that help you ti make up your mind:
<br>1. Graphics isn&apos;t very good.
<br>2. Game is too hard for novice players and children.
<br>3. All endings very logical but not very interesting. They just ok.
<br>
<br>Still if you like rich and story driven games and you understand this is indie and not AAA title - just give it a try. Demo is free. Maybe you find out it is wonderfull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5741893">Expand</a></span>

You have complete freedom to create your character and you choose several different &quot;class questlines&quot;.
<br>
<br>This is an important distinction because you can always cross over to a different questline if you don&apos;t like your current one. And you will not complete everything to do in this game through one playthrough. If you play a fighter, you are not going to go delve into the history of lost temples, you are just going to smash things. If you play an assassin you are not going to mediate political conflicts peacefully.
<br>But thats the beauty of this game. Its several in one. You are not the &quot;chosen one&quot;. You are just a person who makes choices that meaningfully impact the game world. Some campaigns are longer than others, depending on your choices. And there is no wrong choice. There are some that benefit you and some that kill you. But whats an RPG without the risk of sudden death?
<br>
<br>The setting includes a post nuclear city, hidden temples, modern tech mixed with old, military camps, city ruins, legions, gods and demons.
<br>
<br>This is not a lazy modern game where you can go find the most powerful weapon early on and become unstoppable halfway through. Or your abilities can be maxed out allowing you to complete any quest and never fail at anything. This game rewards failure. You learn, or you can actually get better rewards for being selfish and failing a quest. Old RPG&apos;s force you to think. This game is not ruled by a RNG. Sometimes it can be against you but if you are under-powered then defeating the arena champion is going to be sheer luck. But spending one extra skill point on dodge or different tactics can guarantee you a win. There is no better feeling than sending three heavily armored foes into the afterlife single-handedly after a hard fight. There is no spamming a spell or a shout here.
<br>
<br>My favorite things that I enjoyed about this game were the finishing moves in combat, the big battles you can participate in, the number of options you have in completing any quest, the setting, that what you wear actually shows on your character, surprising outcomes for failure, every intelligent enemy can be reasoned with, and yes, I like the graphics despite not being cutting edge.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think there is anything like it today and I recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5837123">Expand</a></span>

For this is a game that, while not being very long, is certainly one of the widest games I have ever played.
<br>
<br>Without spoilers, it has four acts, one per city and a finale where your former choices lead to one or another ending.
<br>
<br>In each of these acts, you will be following a storyline that depends on your background (including your statistics) and your previous choices. You will also partake in some side quests, which are also background and choices dependant.
<br>
<br>A single walkthrough will not be very long, a couple hours for a pure talker, a bit more for a combat focused character (the fighting system is well made and well detailed and would work well in a squad-based tactical game I think), but it will show you only one (or a couple for well-designed builds) facets of the big picture.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, you will have a lot of choices to make in most walkthrough, more so than in most RPG around, but what makes this game stand high and what will certainly make it stand the test of time is that, after several walkthoughs, there will still be shadows and mysteries to uncover for a new hero.
<br>
<br>Let us hope this game will not be one-of-his-kind and that other developers and designers will follow in his footsteps, taking all what is good in it and improving on these bases.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665317">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d say mithril - cautiously called &quot;blue steel&quot; - certainly looks goofy in this pseudo-Antiquity setting.
<br>
<br>But as a classic CRPG this game delivers on all fronts from character creation to the consequences of your choices. Said consequences aren&apos;t always immediate and sometimes it&apos;s really hard to guess where one seemingly insignificant decision may ultimately take you. Choose any path you want but remember: you aren&apos;t the chosen one and the world doesn&apos;t revolve around you. You&apos;re a nobody and to become anything more than that you must prove your worth one way or another (but not by killing rats in a basement) and it&apos;s very easy to perish while trying to do so.
<br>
<br>The dialogues are beautifully written and, which is even more important, the NPCs aren&apos;t one-dimensional walking tropes you expect to meet in a modern RPG. They talk and behave like real people would; their motives, actions and reactions feel reasonable and natural. They also live their lives (instead of forever standing in one place or wandering aimlessly). Their fortunes change - sometimes drastically - as you progress through the game. A lot of thought and effort has been put into character development and it shows.
<br>
<br>But perhaps the greatest strength of AoD is replayability - and not the fake replayability we&apos;ve all seen all too often. Here you can have several totally different plathroughs here depending on what faction(s) you join and how you choose to deal with obstacles. Quests have various solutions and different paths don&apos;t lead to the same conclusion
<br>
<br>Highly recommended. A game of this caliber in this day and age is a diamond among pebbles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5731439">Expand</a></span>

I think that&apos;s what makes this game fun; trying to live by in a **** world and try to follow the story line as a curious person.  you can&apos;t make the outcome you want all the time (i had to change sides a couple of times, just to survive) and that&apos;s how a realistic role play should be, imo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5754055">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game offers great choices, the character development is interesting, you get to constantly use your skills in conversation checks, multiple branches of ways to solve a quest. All this with a compelling story. A real gem for all hardcore crpg fans.</span>

However, the game also creates barriers to fun and enjoyment in the same breath.  Combat is challenging it is punishing and to be avoided.  It&apos;s refreshing to have something different but not quite as polished and fun as I hoped the final version would be.</span>

<br>Unfortunately, their delivery boils down to leveling up &quot;intimidate&quot; or another skill from their limited selection, then picking the &quot;intimidate&quot; option when it is highlighted and available. This would be standard fare for RPGs, but this game only offers dialog trees with a depth of 1-2 options. Furthermore, Undertale, the other indie game of the year offering alternatives to combat, makes the shallowness of Age of Decadence&apos;s system harder to ignore.
<br>
<br>Perhaps much more gameplay would be added if there wasn&apos;t an indication of &quot;[intimidate]&quot;, and the option just appeared among the rest as normal. As it is, while playing the game, there is almost no player freedom or agency. It is, &quot;Do you want the good option or the bad option&quot; rather than &quot;Here are options, try to figure out which is best, or makes sense for your character and context.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5865250">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It reminds me of the old arcade game Dragon&apos;s Lair, where there were several moves you could make in a scene, but all of them but one lead to a colorful death.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s not &quot;hardcore&quot;-style, as the devs would have you believe,  that&apos;s &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;-style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5641319">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let me start by saying that I appreciate difficult games. I am very fond of true roguelikes, and restarting a game multiple times doesn&apos;t bother me, as long as I can expect a different experience each time.
<br>
<br>AoD does not deliver this. What we have here is a very linear progression, but with artificial limitations force by the extremely stringent stat and skill points. There may be multiple ways of accomplishing an objective, however the end result is essentially the same.
<br>
<br>This model essentially forces you to choose to be either a talker, or a fighter - hybrid builds are invariably fatally underpowered. Generally speaking, since you have less skills to spread your points as a fighter, it is easier to build a strong pure fighting character than it is a pure talker - there are several different types of persuasion mechanics as a talker, which are sometimes tested at the same time. You might be great at disguise, but if the check called for disguise AND trading, you&apos;re screwed.
<br>
<br>There are crafting abilities as well, however your points are spread thin enough as it is, and sinking points into crafting can set back your progress significantly.
<br>
<br>Note that the above are all gameplay complaints, but I&apos;d like to talk for a moment about the graphics and interface. Now, I&apos;m not normally a graphics whore, but this game looks...not good. At best, the graphics are 10 years behind current gen. I think they would have been better off with an isometric view (like Baldur&apos;s Gate) than trying for full 3D. Additionally, the controls are very wonky, and the screens extremely bare.
<br>
<br>The setting itself is intriguing, and is the basis for what points I did give this game. There are interesting aspects to the story, but some of it is never fully fleshed out, and what is there is vastly overshadowed by the poor overall design.
<br>
<br>If it&apos;s on sale, might be picking up as a curiosity, but prepare to become frustrated with the game design quickly. Posts on the AoD forums suggest using console commands to make your experience more tolerable, which is an obvious indicating that the game is poorly balanced - if your own forums contain suggestions on how to modify the game to make it better, you have failed at game design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5628319">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What I hate most about this game is that there are stat checks behind every major conversation option and in all quest related story elements; as well as steep skill checks involved in everything very early in the game. This amounts to very frustrating and illogical game flow. The combat is flat out bad, everything will kill you as you are so far behind any curb that your best attacks will just miss most of the time against any single opponent let alone multiple ones, this is one aspect I should have appreciated but I cant stomach how irrelevant combat skills seem to hold up against the encounters in this game.
<br>
<br>I could go into the aesthetic and other game qualities but this game is more RPG than eye candy, in fact I could liken this to a choose your own adventure book with interactive graphics, content gated behind a plethora of stat/skill checks to the point of ridiculousness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547350">Expand</a></span>

This game however is really the worst I played. I finished it in about 22 hours, one playthrough, and finished only to write this review. The combat is pretty boring. All you do is correctly spend your skill points before. And then click and try one of the things. I put all my points into fighting skills and was pretty much doing the standard attack all the time. I was hoping the lore and dialogs in the game would keep the game interesting for me, but it didn&apos;t. Each dialog or quest is supposedly handcrafted according to developer, so you really don&apos;t learn anything but just trying to guess what to click. Also, if failed a quest the best thing is to reload (and you reload a lot in this game) and forget about it. The ending is anti-climatic. Camera, controls, interface - all of this is so old and clunky. I am not a graphics whore but this is definitely too much. Hardcore games don&apos;t mean they are just hard. I prefer games that are easy to learn and hard to master. This one is hard to learn and hard to master. Play PoE, Underrail or Legends of Eisenwald - all these games are at least twice as fun compared to AoD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5607040">Expand</a></span>

Its not old-school hardcore in fact lots of old school games like Wizardry were **** It unintuitive in its design, dumb as dirt story, assets look like crap. Its sold as post-apocalyptic but you wouldnt know that when playing it. Its basically a game heavily reliant on trial and error all the while bragging its deadly difficult. It aint. Its stupidly and dellusionally designed. The Dev/s must be retarded or drunk to even compare this game to Fallout(which it doesnt). Its not realistic like it says it is. Dont believe the shills from RPGcodex praising the flying phuck out of this game. If you must play it just pirate it before actually buying the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=6698437">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You will be subjected to skill checks continuously, and if you decided to spend your skill points differently than the developer intended for that specific quest, your only option will be to retry in another playthrough. Combat is especially difficult at the beginning of the game, until you have harvested sufficient experience and proper gear, resulting in the need to play each predetermined combat encounter in a very specific order from easiest to most difficult. Add to that the dominance of tje random number generator in combat, and you will be reloading a lot if you play as a combat oriented character.
<br>
<br>However, after playing the first chapter in the trial-and-error approach until you find the right sequence of quests, the game becomes more enjoyable. The setting of Roman empire with some magic really works, graphics are really basic but effective (apart from performance issues), items work out well, story is quite interesting,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=6279102">Expand</a></span>

Its yet another infinity engine throwback game but lets get real, it is a lite version of the old games and is not nearly as good. They try to make this game unique by making it restrictive (and calling that hard... it isnt) but that is not enough for me to make it enjoyable. It is missing the fun factor.</span>

But you should do this because other few quests needs certain amount of rightly distributed skill points. Few mistakes in a distribution on early stages make the game nearly impassible. Nevertheless I managed to finish it and the end was absolutely boring.</span>

They are trying to sell it as an RPG, but at best this can be classified as a visual novel. They also sell it as hard, but it not hard at all, you just have to play it exactly as the devs want you, or else.... A visit to the dentist is more enjoyable than playing this &apos;game&apos;.</span>

<br>Average writing. Walls and walls and walls of text: 101 on how *not* to write. Mock-Roman &quot;lore&quot; you don&apos;t care about (and neither do the writers, considering they scrap it for sci-fi half-way). Despite posing as &quot;grimdark&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; you get strangers talking their heads off to you at the slightest opportunity.

<br>Started off promising but ended up in a puff. Quite a waste of time but fun for the first 5-10 hours, probably not worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=5906044">Expand</a></span>

While a far cry better than many recent railroaded games, this still feels somewhat incomplete, there are plenty of places where it could have been improved. It felt as though they needed to spend a bit more time brainstorming options for each class/Play-style to solve each puzzle. The graphics were not the best, even for the style, could barely tell one gender from the other most of the time, though they were in some ways better than many similar games games I have seen lately that are going for the same style. Graphics are not near the top of my list of priorities, but it is on the list, and while it is a minor point, it would be nice if they were slightly better, but that is the least of my issues, and more of something to laugh about rather than a real complaint. My biggest problem with the graphics was that considering how low res they were, the game lagged out a lot and had rather long load times.
<br>
<br>All of that said, I am still enjoying the variations they have managed to work in, and look forward to seeing more of it. It is challenging to get enough exp to distribute enough points to complete all of the available quests, however I have not tried all of the classes yet, so I may not have figured it out correctly, however, it feels as though the first town could have used a few more minor quests, or a couple bigger ones. Give you a bit more room to play if you are not trying to do a min/max run.
<br>
<br>From the archetypes, to the various options to get through the game, this is a huge step in the right direction, and I look forward to seeing it once they are done patching it. It is far from perfect, but as limited as the choices were, they were far better than most &quot;AAA&quot; games, claiming to be &quot;RPGs&quot;. It it nice to see an RPG that isn&apos;t trying to be something else, that does a much better job giving the illusion of choice in some places, and giving optional play styles. The big publishers could learn a lot from what they tried to do here. It is nice to see different ways to solve a quest other than which weapon to use...
<br>
<br>It is all well and good to make their hybrid games, there is clearly a market for them, however there is also still a market a more pure RPG game experience, more focused on the roots of RPGs, with options. It certainly isn&apos;t easy, but it is much more fun than anything I have played in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-age-of-decadence/user-reviews?user_review_id=6058235">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only serious flaw is heavy reliance on randomness in combat encounters, but it won&apos;t ruin your experience.</span>
