I believe that this is far and away the most immersive RPG I&apos;ve ever played. It is also the first RPG that actually made me feel that the choices I made had real consequences. The dialogue options have a lot of variety and at times I find myself wondering what would have happened in response had I chosen something else. The combat system is wonderful, I love the tactics involved. Although the system of pausing and issuing orders makes combat seem almost turn based in complicated situations it also feels more rewarding to me personally after having out matched my opponents on a strategic level. The only real critism I have is that outside of specialization, character customization is a bit limited, there aren&apos;t really many important talent trade offs. Any time I make a Tank character it&apos;s pretty much going to be the same build or if I make a rogue or archer or healer or mage. I would have liked it more had I been forced to choose talents that would make a more magic oriented tank or more single target oriented damage dealer etc. Maybe I was just looking for a more fleshed out specialization system. Anyway back to how awesome the game is; Dragon Age Origins is definitely a game that I recommend buying even just as a salute to the developers for great game making. Even though I haven&apos;t finished the game I already see myself spending hours and hours repeatedly playing it through with different classes and on different difficulties; and even now I feel a bit anxieous that I might finish it too soon and have to dread waiting for a new expansion or sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=740379">Expand</a></span>

The game takes you into a fantasy world that you don&apos;t want to leave. It is a single player experience that I haven&apos;t had since I played Oblivion. While the gameplay is not exactly like that of the Elder Scrolls series, it is close in its theme. I had never played an RPG like this before, because I found the whole concept rather tedious. After my friend saying that he was pretty jazzed about getting this game, I vowed to give it an honest try. By the time I&apos;d finished the origin portion of the game, I was completely hooked. The voice acting is excellent for the most part, and the graphics are pretty good, although the PC version requirements seem to be considerably high for the graphics quality. My son has no trouble with playing it with his dual core AMD CPU, but he has a pretty good graphics card. I guess the best thing I could say about the game, is that I don&apos;t want it to end. After playing for more than 50 hours I still have a way to go before finishing my first play through. I will play it through again after giving it a break for a couple of months, and try my hand at a different class of character. That must tell you something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=741249">Expand</a></span>

Beyond being a sublime game, dragon age origins pushes the boundaries of emotion, choice, and freedom within gaming. DAO doesn&apos;t simply faithfully receive Baldur&apos;s Gate II&apos;s mantle of best game out there, it rips that mante from BG2&apos;s cold, dead hands, then uses it as a weapon to single handedly enslave every other game in existence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394559">Expand</a></span>

Left alone, it will either sit around doing nothing, which means you go nowhere if you&apos;ve chosen to play a ranged or back-line support class--or else it will rush blindly into enemies, leaving you to perform damage control and clean up behind as it continues to charge forward without pause. If you play on anything above casual difficulty, you&apos;ll fight the AI every step of the way and end up having to constantly micromanage your party. The game offers &quot;tactics&quot; slots which you can use to assign conditional behavior patterns to NPC teammates, e.g. &quot;Heal yourself if your health gets below X%,&quot; yet for some insane reason, you have to spend skill points to unlock these tactics slots. Essentially, you must spend skill points to make the AI slightly less stupid. The tactics also need far more flexibility and generality, e.g. &quot;Use any debuff skill not on cooldown&quot; instead of &quot;Use specific skill X.&quot; Because of this, the tactics end up being mostly useless on harder difficulty levels and require you to micromanage the team anyway. On top of these gameplay issues, DAO has a ridiculous amount of dialogue, even by Bioware&apos;s verbose standards. It&apos;s well-written dialogue, for the most part--but it&apos;s still redundant jawing. Too much of the narrative is talked about rather than shown in action. This tendency to tell rather than show has been creeping deeper into each successive Bioware game for years, but it feels like DAO finally crossed the line into self-indulgent writing. Ultimately, the game is simply formulaic: it&apos;s the same linear, on-rails RPG with the same linear, on-rails dialogue &quot;choices&quot; which are supposed to give us the illusion of making moral decisions in tense, finely-shaded conflicts. Bioware has been making this same well- (if over-) written, painstakingly-realized, yet ultimately stultifying and narratively-funneled game for years. While playing, I kept thinking how cinematic the game felt, and how much more I would have enjoyed it as an animated film, or a novel. Dragon Age: Origins is a throwback RPG addled by last-gen gameplay and self-indulgent, tedious writing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=742343">Expand</a></span>

I hate grinding more than anything in the world, so I loved this &quot;feature&quot;. The other people who will probably not like this game are the hardcore D&amp;D fans. Much of the nuances of D&amp;D are not in this game, and for me that is welcome. I don&apos;t think walking empty fields in games like Oblivion and Fallout 3 is fun, granted that every once and awhile you find a &quot;cool&quot; hidden area or side quest, its not worth the time, for some mundane quest with little to nothing to do with the storyline. Every quest in Dragon Age, down to the leveling &quot;Request Board&quot; quests, are expertly crafted into the main plot and often branching. No, there are no find the +16 mace in the randomly generated dungeon with the same enemies you have been fighting for the last 120 hours...and I&apos;m fine, no I&apos;m ecstatic, about that. I play a game to enjoy it, but to complete it in a &quot;timely&quot; fashion, so I can move on to the next game. For me, games like Diablo and Neverwinter nights cheaply increased there length with pointless side-quests or by including equally mundane multiplayer, and I don&apos;t understand how they can be fun other then by the mind trick they employ, of using a gauged-reward system (similar to what you find with slot machines in a Casino). Dragon Age trims the fat, and while there is plenty to explore, a after-work gamer will still be able to beat it (for the first time) in a month or 2 and probably a month if you want a second go...which for me, is perfect. But don&apos;t get me wrong, this isn&apos;t halo were you can beat the game with your eyes closed, on the normal difficulty the game is challenging and will require you to think, which I really enjoyed. I logged 45 satisfied hours at my first run, and after beating some of the new games that are out. I will most surely give it another go. 3 major problems though. 1. the DLC sucks, i got all 3 and they were all a waste of money, they are also integrated into the main game so much that you feel almost as if you &quot;have&quot; to do them...they are all skip-able. 2. To many pointless NPC interactions, half the time you can give 2 different responses and get the exact same answer, I&apos;m not a real &quot;role-player&quot; maybe if you are one, this makes the game more &quot;realistic&quot; but for me, it was just annoying. 3. The game has memory leaks, if you sit for a long session the loading times get longer and longer and longer, this is fixed by a restart of the game, but an annoying problem never-the-less Highly Recommend for any normal gamer like me, who enjoys a well thought out, well put together game for (I can&apos;t after reading the other reviews on here emphasize this enough) NORMAL people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=745633">Expand</a></span>

The combat is fast paced, and depending on the level of difficulty, very tactical. The voice acting is amazing, better then any I have ever heard. The writing is as good as any New York Times bestseller, keeping you at the edge of your swivel chair the whole way through.

This game is my most favorite game and i can&apos;t even explain of how amazing this game is. The story is amazing one of the best which i experienced, the gameplay is very unique and i guess some will not like the gameplay but for me the gameplay was perfect, character are funny,amusing,interesting and very easy to like, the graphic for me is very beautiful and i didn&apos;t encounter any bugs or any kind of technical issue. All the rpg elements like customization,dialogue,exploration,side missions,items and inventory,skills,abilities,experience and levels all of that is executed perfectly. In the end the only thing i can say about Dragon Age Origins that this is the best game i have ever played in my life</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=2245475">Expand</a></span>

I reserved my judgement on DAO until I completed it. The first thing i&apos;d say is that this game is definately the best RPG on release at this moment. With a few more games coming out here in 2010, fans of this genre are in for some good times, and if you haven&apos;t yet played this game then you really should. Graphically, if you have a high end card and a halfway decent CPU then you are in for a visual treat. I played 50% of this game on an 8800gtx and the last 50% on an ATI 5870. The difference between the two allowed me to max out my screen at 1920x1200 and also max out all the settings in-game and whack on some AA. The game looked amazing. Not to say the ageing 8800 couldn&apos;t handle it, because it could, but I had to play it in 1680x1050 and lower some of the settings. The game has a main storyline which is a bit Lord of the Rings, but without the rings, and the mass of orcs replaced by Darkspawn, which in essence are the same kind of thing, basically marauding humanoids hellbent on wiping out humanity, which is kind of ironic. To achieve your goals you will have to take part in a series of subplots, which in themselves are rather epic in scale. Tie this in with a large dose of sidequests and you will soon find yourself overwhelmed with quests in your log. So, where does DAO drop from a 10 to a 9? Well, as i&apos;m sure others have mentioned, sometimes the sidequests are very &quot;chorelike&quot; and you can find yourself quickly being taken away from the main objectives you want to achieve for large chunks of time. If you become addicted to the game and play for 5-6 hours solid per session, you could end up sporadically feeling that you haven&apos;t achieved much in the session. I myself, played some days like that, and other days I would play for an hour or two, and some days I&apos;d leave it alone completely. When coming back to it, I would feel refreshed and ready to plough on. As for difficulty, playing the game on it&apos;s default level is a real challenge for many players i&apos;m sure. Being an old timer myself, and having played too many RPG&apos;s to list, I found the challenge on the default setting just right. I died in places I expected to once stepping into a fight I knew were going to require a learning curve to beat, and once beat, I felt a real sense of achievement. Fortunately the combat mechanics in DAO are very well implemented. The tactics you can give to your team are in depth, and the game provides easy to use setups should you not want to spend time mastering your own tactics for each character. The game comes with DLC that you can purchase for a reasonable cost, and if you didn&apos;t get the deluxe version that comes with most of it, then buying it is definately something you want to do, especially Soldier&apos;s Peak which provides you with a chest for storage. From start to finish, Dragon Age Origins is a masterpiece on the PC. It has very few technical issues (at least on my machine), and plays smoothly. A definate recommendation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=744464">Expand</a></span>

This, from what I&apos;ve read is old school type of RPG. This is different from Oblivion, which for newcomers to the RPG type game, was very easy to pick up. Dragon Age: Origins (DAO) has a different mechanic than that of Oblivion and Fallout 3. At first I found it intimidating, but now with more than just a few hours under my belt, I&apos;m really into this game. The quests come in fast and furious and the main story line and voice acting are excellent. The combat is fun as well, once you get a handle on the controls, and setting up your party. I guess you could blow through the campaign just to get to the end as fast as you can, but I&apos;m enjoying the atmosphere of the game. The dialoge between your party members while you walk adds to the community feeling within a single player game. A tutorial would have been nice, but thankfully both my sons are old pros at these games and I now no longer need their help (errr. . .for the basics. . .) A really good game and I highly recommend it to even non-RPG players. Put an effort into learning the game mechanics, and you may enjoy it more than Oblivion</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=739157">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is one of the bes with, old Bioware-Activision top notch dialogues, a very helpful and immersive CODEX (a kind of encyclopedia), almost real characters and a very helpful UI and intuitive interaction menus.

What technical glitches or loading screens that annoy the player is more than compensated for by the characters the PC encounters and the emotions they can draw from him/her. These emotions are what Molyneaux, of the Fable franchise, tried to coax out of the players, but failed to do so. Dragon Age makes you care for your companions, who get mad at you for doing something stupid and who may develop change-of-hearts due to you nourishing your relationships with. This is what role-playing should be able to do: make you care for the people you meet and the world you are in. Of course, you can also choose not care. You can frustrate your companions, anger them until some are forced to draw their weapons against you. You can damn the world by electing poor leaders, or massacring groups of people, or dooming souls for your benefit. That is something this game does well, the element of role-playing. In the end, as far as the year has gone, no other game executes the same element as well as Dragon Age does. That&apos;s why there is no denying it is the best 2009 has to offer in RPGs, even the naysayers and flamers have no coherent argument to the contrary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=741239">Expand</a></span>

To contest some of the negative user reviews and forewarn potential buyers, you&apos;re not buying something akin to Diablo or The Elder Scrolls here. Dragon Age follows the tradition of relatively linear, but well told role playing adventures like Baldur&apos;s Gate, Neverwinter Nights, etc. Be prepared for a complex story and great character development (in terms of loot, stats, and stories), not a big free-roaming world or endless waves of monsters to click on. There are plenty of side quests and places to wander off the beaten path, but the game generally keeps you focused on the central plot. With that in mind, Dragon Age is a truly epic game. Bioware have gone from developing excellent games in other people&apos;s universes to producing equally excellent titles with completely new worlds to support them. If you can stomach some serious micromanaging and almost as much dialogue as gameplay, don&apos;t pass this title up. Its the best RPG I&apos;ve played since... well... the last Bioware title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=742580">Expand</a></span>

Nor do they have any idea of what it means to be objective as a reviewer, which really has nothing to do with whether or not the game suits your personal tastes, yet none of these mmo and/or console generation fanboys seem to understand that simple concept. The fact is that Dragon Age is a very well made game, with a few minor bugs and glitches that would be expected in a release of this size. The combat system resembles a Baldur&apos;s Gate/NWN hybrid, but puts a simpler spin on the more complex DnD rules that were used by DA&apos;s aforementioned predecessors. This is not to say that combat doesn&apos;t require some micromanagement, because it does, and combat throughout is not meant to be rushed into mindlessly, guns blazing. This isn&apos;t God of War, it&apos;s an actual RPG, tactical thought will be required. Anyone turned off by that notion shouldn&apos;t be playing the game to begin with. Bioware does a great job in getting back to what made the genre itself so powerful with past titles, and created an RPG that is a ROLE playing game, not a ROLL playing game. This game features less min/maxing and damage meter watching, and focuses more on story and deep meaningful character development. Whether you like that or not depends on your own tastes as a gamer, but if the past is any indicator of success, the deep and ongoing story will be what truly continues to drive the franchise, beyond just this opening act. One thing that continued to surprise me during my time with this title was the codex, as simple a concept as it is, the depth of the lore and backstory is unparalleled in any recent undertaking, even by Bioware. Anyone who has played video games in the last decade has most likely heard of Bioware, and anyone familiar with their previous titles knows that dialogue will be a focal point of the game. Traditional multiple choice response interface follows, but the game does begin to make you feel as though your responses, as well as your actions will ultimately have an effect somewhere down the line in the story. This may not always be the case, but even the fact that this is a possibility makes the experience a much more conscious and relevant one. The game is not perfectly realized however, as level design does see a bit of staleness, and graphics feel very dated. These things do not detract from the experience as much as they would with smaller caliber titles however, and the scope of story and development still shine through the dull exterior colors. It would have been nice to see a bit more item variation within the game as well. Crafting becomes dependent on a very few important reagents, rather than having the more complex and powerful craftables require more work. There is too much in this game to go over at once, but these were just a few of the more relevant points of note. Overall, if you truly enjoy a story driven RPG, and you aren&apos;t put off by a lot of dialogue or combat micromanagement, this game is absolutely worth your time, and despite it&apos;s long playtime with all the side quests, will keep you coming back to get your money&apos;s worth for multiple plays through and future DLC and expansions. In a very thin and watered down gaming market, this was an actual bright spot, a shining beacon of hope for a genre that is being killed by the disposable MMO and the typical console gamer. One of the best new titles of 2009.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=744111">Expand</a></span>

There are a lot of cutscenes, quantity enough to be imbalanced at first, but once you get deep enough into it--hours into the game--the actual gameplay finally balances out. I never played Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 so I can&apos;t compare to that, but the game does remind me a lot of Oblivion in some ways, at least as far as NPC interactions go, outside of party interactions. You might call it a cross between Mass Effect in interactions+exploring+fighting gameplay style, Oblivion in setting style, and some 2D RPGs like Neverwinter Nights in party-forming and DA&apos;s optional overhead isometric viewing (perhaps this is where Balders Gate 2 comes in? .. I wouldn&apos;t know). I do have a complaint about some of the textures, some of them look and feel awfully low-res, but they&apos;re at least made up for with lots of hi-res ones. The actual gameplay is fun, but the time it takes to level my main character up enough to have more than three or so special attacks is arduous. Overall, it&apos;s a great game. I only play AAA top-notch games anymore these days--too little time to play the merely &quot;good&quot; games--so the fact that I&apos;m still playing Dragon Age should say a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=740386">Expand</a></span>

A few minor glitches, but nothing that detracts from it being the best game from Bioware in a long time. Heres to more adventures into the amazing world of Dragon Age! Cheers!</span>

That is no doubt. The voice-work is top notch and the story is immersive and very well written. Every character you encounter, from the lowly guard to the players in your party, has a unique attitude. Interacting with these characters can be a challenge if you&apos;re trying to be the &apos;good guy&apos; because a lot of the choices are unclear as to being right or wrong. Do you kill the child and slay the demon with it or do you sacrifice his mother to save the boy? To make matters more confusing are the extremely different perspectives of your party and how they think of you for doing certain things. Trying to balance a happy party is tough work but with a little help from gifts you acquire along the way, it is feesable to make most of your party pleased with you. Combat is challenging to say the least. Managing your partys actions in combat can be a chore at times. You have very limited combat tactics slots to start with and even as you gain more, you get more and more skills along the way to fill up those few slots. Leaving your team to do their own thing works for the most part using this system but to kill harder foes, you&apos;ll more than likely need to take control of them manually in order to access all of their abilities. And trust me, you&apos;ll need to use all of the tricks up their sleaves. The mosters of DA:O are no push overs. These aren&apos;t your run-of-the-mill RPG trash monsters you crush for XP and money; every battle counts. Even early on you&apos;ll find yourself running low on health potions and such. I recommend rolling a healer to start, honestly. I started off as a 2-handed sword swinging brute and later regretted it as combat became more and more difficult without a healer to back me up in the early parts of the game. I could go on for a while about DA:O but I won&apos;t delve too much deeper on a Metacritic review. Overall the game is fantastic. Rich lore, great story, exciting (and bloody) combat, amazing sound effects (the combat sounds real), a variety of armor and weapons, skills and items, and downloadable content already out with more to come, I&apos;m sure, make this game definately worth the price tag and then some. $50 bucks for 100 hours of gameplay with numerous endings and extremely high replayability. Can&apos;t beat that anyway you look at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=738532">Expand</a></span>

I am a huge rpg fan, finding them to be multiple times more stimulating than any fps. And this is the best Game I have played for a long time! The characters are diverse and intriguing, the combat is exciting and keeps it from becoming tedious due to having to think about tactics- each fight is a real push! I haven&apos;t been this addicted to a game for a very long time! It seems that peoples only trouble is the extent to which it is an original game? My argument is that the fantasy genre has been done so many times that its hard to innovate. There is the danger of being so bogged down in doing something new that it ruins the game, the storyline becoming too convulated and weak. The game play becomes complicated in its innovation, and it becomes tedious to play. The only problem with a lack of originality is that because you have seen it all before it doesn&apos;t stimulate you. However dragon age origins doesn&apos;t have this probowm beauase it is the top pf the genre. All in all get this game you won&apos;t regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=738762">Expand</a></span>

The world is remarkable largely for it&apos;s amazing depth, and the true three dimensionality of the characters and relationships between them.

It&apos;s hugely reminiscent of Baldur&apos;s Gate in gameplay, although I could see it being confusing for people who weren&apos;t fans of the genre back then. It&apos;s not a simple game, by any means. I really don&apos;t understand what people are talking about when they say it&apos;s like last gen&apos;s graphics; i&apos;ve got the settings maxed out on my pc and honestly, it&apos;s pretty stunning. Voice acting is really well done, and party members bounce off one another superbly. There have been some lines that made me laugh out loud while playing. Keeping everybody happy is proving to be quite a challenge too, much more so than Mass Effect of KOTOR were. I welcome the challenge; it makes you really consider everything you do much more carefully. Speaking of which, I&apos;ve been moaning for years the polarity of &apos;morality choices&apos; in these games. I applauded the initiative to make choices matter, but found the execution lacking. Everything was always &apos;be good&apos; or &apos;be evil&apos;, with no interesting choices. Bioware have really nailed it in this game. So far, at around 30 hours into the game, I&apos;ve encountered situations where there is no good or bad choice; rather I&apos;ve found myself confronted by agonising decisions where there are no right answers, and every choice could conceivably have disasterous outcomes for all involved. The major decisions in this game carry a lot of weight, and I&apos;m really looking forward to seeing how they play out through the rest of the campaign. This is the most engaging RPG i&apos;ve played in nearly a decade, and although it&apos;s not perfect, and definitely not for everyone, it&apos;s a comfortable 10 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=739497">Expand</a></span>

It took me about 12 hours of gameplay to get to the point where it was no longer terrible. 40 hours in, I was really enjoying myself. By 80 hours, I was addicted. Reminiscent of a single-player World of Warcraft with more strategy involved.</span>

For example combat is not as fluid as it should be but engaging story, chalenging fights and some very memorable characters (Morrighan honey... I&apos;ll come back to you every year, I promise!) let me forget about minor issues and enjoy it a lot.</span>

The characters, the assorted collection of companions, the voice work, the personalities, the playful banter, the diversity on the main/side quests, and most importantly the choices presented at every turn allow you to really shape the adventure in your own eyes.
<br>
<br>The choices themselves were all so deeply routed in fundamental morality that the story essentially teases, tempts, and tests your conscience and better judgment. You basically have a little angel on one shoulder and a little demon on the other the entire time. Do it! Do it! They whisper, but who will you listen to? Throw in the fact that the storytelling itself is filled with all forms of deceit, scandal, and just about every other Shakespearean trick in the book made it a joy to play through.
<br>
<br>And of course mention to the combat is important. Tactical, strategic, challenging. Its the standard deep proven D&amp;D real-time (optionally pause-able) party-based combat that just works. I never had any issues with the AI not following my pre-designed tactic rule sets or the enemy AI doing anything dumb. Only slightly disappointing thing here was the limitation on the number of tactical slots for each character as it tended to hamper more intricate and useful automated strategies.
<br>
<br>Final Score: 9/10. Love the first play-through and still feel a second one has lots to offer not only story wise, but difficulty wise should one dare to test their skill on the Hard or Insane difficulties.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Various nitpicks below, which prevented me from giving a 10/10. I might as well mention them I figure:
<br>
<br>- Despite being the Ultimate edition patched to the max this game engine loved to crash like crazy on a standard Intel i5 multicore machine. Literally every 10-30mins another random crash to the point I&apos;d have to frequently quick save or risk losing my precious progress. Only after I forced the game to run on a single core did the crashing cease entirely (thank GOD!)
<br>
<br>- Enemies never respawn... ever. If you encounter an area that you are struggling to clear there is no going back and farming some levels so that you can comeback stronger. What you are is what you have. No more raising of gold to buy more potions. No compensating for earlier build errors in your characters. Everything is simply permanent. You can literally be f&apos;ed and have no choice but to drop the game to Easy difficulty level to proceed (especially at the endgame which loves to absolutely f&apos; you hard by dumping you into inescapable quests with no shops to replenish supplies between boss fights. Because of this the last 3 hours of my 60 hour journey were spent in gaming heII).
<br>
<br>- The in-game crafting was lacking to say the least (no smithing at all and the other skills like herbalism mostly an after thought). I also felt at times the character skillsets to be lacking (especially the general skills shared between all classes). And...making you have to hunt the game world to learn some specializations for your characters felt completely unnecessary (one shouldn&apos;t have to run to a Wiki to have fun.)
<br>
<br>- The shapeshifter class. I was so looking forward to this one...only the game makes it so frustrating to use that I literally abandoned it all together. Thing is, the game forceably turns all shapeshifters into human form during every cutscene. Problem? Every boss fight begins with a cutscene. Bigger problem? To reshapeshift requires not only a long spellcast but also a long cooldown on the skill itself. Yeah, you are essentially screwed for even attempting to use this class. Seriously, insta-shifting the character back into animal form after the scene ends would have been a simple fix how did this game have so many patches and an Ultimate edition with this kind of gamebreaking nuisance going unnoticed? Even one of the most useful skills &quot;Overwhelm&quot; wasn&apos;t included in the tactic&apos;s menu at all for shapeshifters (the dog yes, but not shapeshifters) so if you wanted to use it you always had to micromanage it. *shakes head*
<br>
<br>- The final boss fight was an epic battle between you and *spoiler alert* the fking P.O.S. camera. To have such a useful for camera for 95% of the game only to pull that. Really guys?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829673">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Because it does those things right! Bioware successfully replaces the Dnd world with a world created by their own writers. The overarching plot is simple (an evil force that soughts to destroy everything), but has been done very well. Combat has been refined from baldur&apos;s gate/icewind dale series. Choice system is good (not great), etc.. But what this game does primarily well is :
<br>
<br>A) Content! Loads of rpgs have lots of contents. But DA:O makes that content interesting TILL THE END. At no point do you feel bored and exhausted.
<br>
<br>B) Characters! They really stand out and you will remember them even after you have played the game. Each of them has their own motivations for why they are in your team. Again, this has been done before, but DA:O does this all most better than all the other rpgs (atleast wrpgs :P)

I agree with much of what other reviewers have said regarding negatives, but I can&apos;t stop playing this title. Onto the pros and cons: GRAPHICS: The graphics are good over all, but it&apos; clear that they were designed for the overhead &quot;classic&quot; RPG view, because when you zoom into explore mode, the graphics look very old-school. Low quality textures even at the highest setting. The graphics don&apos;t compare to say, Oblivion, but then again, this isn&apos;t Oblivion. The artistry of the graphics is fantastic and the facial modeling is actually light years better than Oblivion; every person actually looks like a different individual as opposed to other games where it&apos;s the 5 male and female faces every time. The towns and forests are well done and really suggest their environments well. In short, more polygons and higher quality textures are needed, but for what it is, it&apos;s great and doesn&apos;t detract from the fun. SOUND: Can&apos;t say enough about it, the soundtrack is phenomenal. I&apos;m glad to see such effort put into a game soundtrack. GAMEPLAY: Definitely different from older BioWare games. Most battles aren&apos;t evenly matched in terms of numbers. It&apos;s not uncommon to fight your four adventurers to say, 12 bandits or undead at a time. However, when in tight spaces, it&apos;s easy to draw out enemies a few at a time into an ambush, but for the plot battles, it&apos;s always in a giant room and four versus 15. So often it&apos;s the old shtick of how-many-health-potions-can-you-use-to-get-through-a-battle. And these enemy numbers aren&apos;t fodder. Enemy archers are absolutely lethal and rogues appear out of thin air and back stab, and the fighters always seem better equipped. Enemy mages are usually weak oddly enough. In fact, mundane bandit battles are much harder than major plot battles. The AI is fair at best. Enemies mindlessly target your mages, even when being battered by your fighters. Large groups of enemies are easily duped into ambushes, and won&apos;t attack until you until you&apos;re very close to them. Enemies have no fear and won&apos;t attempt to flee, nor will they use health poultices. It&apos;s clearly a leveled system, but there are always battles/enemies that are beyond the groups level which serve to conceal this fact (Revenants and High Dragons anyone?) The combat system is classic BioWare and well done. If you liked KotoR and NWN then you will like DAO. The tactics menu is a little to complex in my opinion. You can assign a behavior to an NPC for nearly any scenario imaginable. The skills and spells are well thought out and classes are very customizable with the specialization slots. Weapons and equipment are very well done. No longer do you pine for powerful magic weapons, because regular weapons are also capable due to the interesting variety of fantastical materials they can be made from (veridium, ironbark, etc.) and their crafter (dwarven, Elvish, etc.). Yes, it&apos;s the same thing as magic weapons, but it&apos;s nice to use a simple dwarven silverite sword instead of Unholy Blood Sword of Wrath a la Diablo. STORY: The story is very creative, although it mimics real politics and religion a bit too much. There&apos;s a bit of a departure from the Tolkien standard of the races (dwarves, elves, humans) in the role of the elves, but I have to admit, it&apos;s very interesting. The plot flows well and the game constantly reminds you of it in the mundane encounters. When you run into a battle while traveling, sometimes it will be a group of mercenaries sent by Loghain to hunt you, or darkspawn fighting an ally that you won over recently. The main quest is very well integrated into the game and is never &quot;forgotten&quot; as in Oblivion. CONCLUSION: A must-have title for a BioWare fan, but this may disappoint if you&apos;re expecting a game like Oblivion or the Witcher. It&apos;s old school and that&apos;s what makes it great. In regards to the other reviewers gripes about unbalanced foes and poor party members, it&apos;s simply a matter of using tactics. If you find that are losing battles a lot and getting overwhelmed, change your tactics. Use different party members. Use the tactics menu. A BioWare game means having to pause constantly during a battle and reevaluate tactics. And if you still are losing, then leave it be and wait until you advance. Many battles aren&apos;t meant to be winnable under a certain level. All the plot battles are balanced though, even with large numbers. The game is meant to be playable straight through the main quest, but much of the challenge lies in the side quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=740928">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> WoW. i gotta say this game is one of its kind. I have actually never tried an RPG before so this is my first and i gotta say its freaking AWSOM. Iv always Liked Fps games much more than the boring RPG games like Kotor. Iv played it for 5 days almost and Iv only gotten 25% of the game and i usally play 2 hours or something like that. I Recomend this game to everyone even the Fps players :D</span>

Although the story might not be the most original when looked far apart, but the specific detail into each action to solve the conflict are quite intriguing. I wont say everything I liked about the game, since everyone has pretty much already said it 50 times :P but I do have to mention sound, character interaction, graphics (Maximum on PC) , and the tactical combat system overrule any small flaws. And I wanted a hard game, and I got a hard game, and so I was alright with multiple retries and attempts.

This game gets an A+ for re-playability because of all the different characters and classes you can be. There is a bit of a learning curve, but don&apos;t let it get you down. As soon as you master the pause and strategize method, you will become addicted quickly.</span>

What could have been a drab, outdated fantasy setting was turned into a fully new and realized world and should absolutely not be missed by any fans of RPGs or good games in general. In a world where Call of Duty and Madden steal the spotlight, it&apos;s a breath of fresh air to see a finely-crafted and well-tuned epic appeal to so many.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=739607">Expand</a></span>

The side stories are what really push this game with its wonderfully designed world and lore. It really feels like they put a lot of time and thought into designing the cultures, their historio-religious backgrounds, and their diversity. I can&apos;t help but want to refer to God as &quot;the Maker&quot; afterward. ;) And the gameplay is smooth enough and enjoyable. It may not have real tactical complexity, but it is enjoyable regardless of that - remember folks, it&apos;s not [insert game]! If you give it an honest to goodness try without any kind of expectations related to other games, as long as you don&apos;t already dislike these sorts of games, then I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll enjoy it even if you don&apos;t love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=2774010">Expand</a></span>

They were complex and very intriguing and I absolutely loved the dialogue. So many games limit when you are able to talk to to your companions and I love that you are able to talk to your party members whenever you would like even if your dialogue options have mostly already been explored. The banter between party members was also immensely enjoyable and really add to the experience and help you immerse yourself into your character. Companion quests are probably my favourite thing to have in a role playing game and Dragon Age Origins companion quests were very enjoyable. Also the romance in this game was handled better than any role playing game I have ever played except maybe the Witcher 3 although I personally preferred the Dragon Age Origins romance.
<br>The story was a little cliche and bland at times, but I don&apos;t always consider this to be a significant issue, especially in such a large RPG like Dragon Age Origins where an excessively complex and convoluted storyline may confuse players, and detract from the role playing experience. I absolutely adore the origin quests, where you are able to play out the origins of your character and give your character a unique backstory that you are able to experience firsthand. Also, how your character interacts with both your party members and when you return to your place of origin as a result of what race you choose to be really adds incredible value to the game. The final battle was incredible for me. Not only did the stakes feel high, but that was reinforced by the large scale of it and you really feel that what you are doing is important which is something which many modern roleplaying games fail to grasp.
<br>The combat was also immensely enjoyable for me. I love the tactical and strategic aspect to the fighting although it did get a little repetitive, especially if you are planning to do multiple play throughs.
<br>The gothic atmosphere accompanied by the gorgeous soundtrack also make this game an incredible experience. The music in this game is really underappreciated in my opinion, as the melancholic sound is hauntingly beautiful and really sets the mood of the game
<br>Overall, this is probably my favourite game I have ever played. This game really feels like an RPG thanks in no small part because of the amazing characterisation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=7224482">Expand</a></span>

That being said, it is not without fault. The tactics system, while incredibly customizable, is rather clunky; even with tactics in place, sometimes i will see a warrior off in a corner twiddling his thumbs. There are so many glitches that are exploitable to break gameplay as well: you can be level 20 before even leaving Ostagar with a min/max build where you take points from other stats and pump them all into one choice stat. The difficulty level is also a bit odd...it spikes. You can smash your way through a dungeon with no issues, try to leave, and get annihilated by a random encounter with a small band of Darkspawn within 3 seconds flat. The overall difficulty is not an issue, it&apos;s the spiking up and down and up and down incessantly. But all of this can really be dealt with and ignored, and the captivating storytelling and tactical combat merge to create one of the greatest fantasy epics in video games in recent years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=743514">Expand</a></span>

There are a few downsides to the game also - Graphics seem a bit outdated in comparison to Mass Effect ( feels rushed ), but this can be remedied by downloading player mods which tweak out most of the graphical downturns. Also your own character does not give a voice reply in conversations, which takes away from the game a bit more and the dialogue in general is not as cool as it is was in Mass Effect but these are just minor faults that I&apos;m hoping that Bioware will tweak out in their next release of the Dragon Age series.

I enjoyed the graphic, animations, special fx and combat mechanics a lot, finding the latter to be some nice tactical challenge (granting one not play a wizard, which makes the game a stroll in the park on any difficulty), Unfortunately the game story is very disappointing: great beginning turns out to this same old plot of saving the world from a horde of mindless monsters. Seriously, it does not get more boring and stupid than that. But once you accept the dull storyline, the game really shines and has good replayability potential. Also in my opinions the available dlcs are not worth of the original price, but are nice addition if you can find them in some bundle for few bucks.&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=1630475">Expand</a></span>

I also did not enjoy the combat system... I had no fun with it, so I turned it to the lowest difficulty possible... and well... visuals and combat aside... the story and characters are interesting, involving and the settings... although very dated... still often manage to look beautiful. Face animation is really great... but the music... is completely forgettable.
<br>
<br>In the end... I do not regret any money I spent on it and almost all of its DLC&apos;s... I DID have a great time playing it (on low difficulty), I cared about the characters and I did want to make a change in this (game-) world. In the end I have spent more than 100 hours (!!!) on DA:O with all but one DLC&apos;s (including Awakening! And now you can get the game itself with every single piece of DLC in the Box!

Ehh, no, but it is a very good game.  Solid in its gameplay, the graphics are less than stellar but the NPC interaction of Alistair, Leliana and especially Morrigan make it a very entertaining one.  The storyline itself is fragmented (you start off looking for your brother and then he&apos;s not mentioned again until the end of the game), the major plotline a cliche`.  Some of the decisions you make are impactful, others not so much.  Par for the course for its developer.  The characters are fairly deep, though there&apos;s no character growth during the game (your character and the NPCs who tag along with you stay relatively the same with the exception of Sten and Shale whose views do change).  Still, like I said, this is a very good game, and definitely worth the money.  While it doesn&apos;t hale the return to the top of the RPG heap for Bioware (now a division of EA), it certainly is a step up the ladder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=1645220">Expand</a></span>

The first and last Dragon Age before Bioware taken over by Electronic Farts, don&apos;t bother with the DA2 and DA:I sequels.
<br>
<br>This game is buy far the BEST RPG since Planescape Torment until The Witcher 3 came along. While DA:O is not open world, the game is more than big enough with phenomenal content, both quality and quantity. Don&apos;t know how Bioware pulled it off in the mid 2000s during development but six unique origin stories and NPCs react differently to your origin! no other developer has since pulled this off.
<br>
<br>Lots of twists and very well written intriguing side quests keeps you captivated. I remember playing uptil 4 to 5am every morning just to find out what happens next, this game is that immersive. Companions are the best written and reactive and puts all the others to shame i.e. Fallout 4, Pillars of Eternity. If you want one dimensional companions, go play Skyrim.
<br>
<br>Everything about this game is just epic beyond description in words, the music, battles, alternative endings, funning dialogues choices, the adventure. So sad to see what Bioware have become.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=6223186">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros: Very fun gameplay, story, and generally amazing RPG.
<br>
<br>Cons: Dragon Age Inquisition is terrible and a slap in the face to all Origins fans.  EA should be ashamed, but sadly they are incapable of feeling shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=6659365">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Good:
<br>- Excellent story and an interesting world
<br>- Voice acting is well done
<br>- Squad mates can be hilarious at times
<br>- The character creator is interesting, although not advanced
<br>- Plenty of mods that add more to the game or adjust gameplay
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>- It can be a challenging game to the point of frustration and there is no dificulty setting for those who just want to experience the story [without mods]
<br>- Combat is quite slow and there is not much item variation to spice it
<br>- The player character is not voice acted
<br>
<br>Neutral:
<br>- Graphics are not state of the art even for it&apos;s release in 09... Not a bad thing but some people seem to really hate that</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4223026">Expand</a></span>

Fans of that game will find a lot of similarities here, starting with the fact that the characters and their stories are terrific. It&apos;s hard not to get attached to them, even if you occasionally want to backhand Morrigan or knock some sense into Alistair. The game play hearkens right back to the PC classics of the previous decade, which may be a plus or a minus, depending on your preference. Definitely a plus for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=6859022">Expand</a></span>

Very little concentration on traditional magic in a fantasy game.. hmm... A bit odd there... but then I remember stories like George R.R. Martin and some of the later works by Raymond Feist and I remember the most intriguing parts of any story isn&apos;t the powerful magic, but all the plots and subplots.. the twists and turns behind every quest and subquest. Delving a bit deeper into the storyline I really had a difficult time remembering that I was playing a game and not witnessing a rich story unfold from a fictional text. The story is immense, the combat challenging, and the replayablility makes me wonder why more games can&apos;t be like this. Kudos go to the Bioware team that developed this game and Kudos to anyone who takes the time to pick up this fantastic game. I can&apos;t wait to see all the additional content that will be developed for this game by the community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=738457">Expand</a></span>
