<br>
<br>Everything is put in an isometric perspective with lovely candy graphics. The world is divided into island to which you travel by sailing your boat. Our main hero has no name but looks very similar to Link - although without the cap - but with the sword and the shield the inspiration is unmistakable. Your goal is to kill the monster called Oceanhorn - to do so you will need to travel the world, discover new locations, solve puzzles and gain necessary abilities.
<br>
<br>This game gives a very laid back feeling. The gameplay is very good as well. Fighting, travelling the world, solving puzzles, even fishing are all well done. I really enjoyed my time playing the game and can easily recommend it to any Zelda fan out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6539290">Expand</a></span>

Plays well on my PC, but I only updated my rig so I&apos;m not sure how it does on older machines. You should not expect a full AAA+ experience, but you don&apos;t pay a full AAA+ price. This game is well worth the money spent i.m.o.</span>

The art style is, however, actually quite different. WW is quite Disney-like, whereas Oceanhorn is colorful, but not so cartoonish.</span>

                                        <span>Closest thing to a Zelda on PC, I had great time with it. The main quest takes around 12 hours to complete, probably more if you collect everything. The game has a nice little level up system, unlike in any Zelda games and there&apos;s tons of things to do besides the main quest. Collecting &apos;bloodstones&apos; and fishing were fun touches. Recommended to all action RPG fans!</span>

But what game nowadays, hell, what piece of art or work doesn&apos;t draw inspiration from SOMEWHERE?  So, not holding that against it.  Oceanhorn is a mediocre title.  Not great, not awful.  Game play wise it is sufficiently fun.  Lack of consistency of physics makes puzzles hard to figure out sometimes.  Sometimes you can push blocks, sometimes you can&apos;t.  Sometimes you can jump down a cliff, sometimes you can&apos;t.  Sometimes you can swim somewhere and barely make it before drowning, sometimes you can&apos;t.   The music can be great at times.  But the animations are clunky and the writing, story, and voice acting are god awful.  The voice actors are amateurs at best and either they were given the wrong script or it was put in wrong because the captions often don&apos;t match the voice dialogue.  And the person who wrote the dialogue and story clearly failed English.  If this was a short story turned into a teacher, it would have gotten a D at best.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game had a lot of promise, but lacked the polish it needed before it was released.  Not bad, just not very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5382420">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has a charming artistic style and feel but it quickly falls apart as you dive into it.
<br>
<br>Oceanhorn unabashedly borrows most of the major mechanics from the Zelda franchise, including sword/shield fighting, bombs, arrows, dungeons, bosses, quests, etc. and does them all rather worse. Controls are clunky at best, with the character only loosely obeying control commands and not quickly. The game compensates for this by making the bosses (with 2 notable exceptions) extraordinarily easy.
<br>
<br>There are random sailing around sequences that serve no purpose but to waste your time. They contribute nothing at all to the story or game advancement. It would be much better to simply have you select the next island you want to go to from the map (actually you pretty much do that anyway).
<br>
<br>To say the story is cliche is an insult to cliches. Father eaten by monster. You get his sword and seek vengeance/answers, princess to save, old sensei to guide you. You get the drift.
<br>
<br>Puzzles are decent-ish but most of the thinking required in the game involves trying to figure out where to go next, or what seemingly-random item you need to collect once you get there. The game does very little in the way of giving you clues on where to go or what to do, at times feeling too open and simultaneously claustrophobic, because you don&apos;t REALLY have to get in your damn boat for 10 minutes again just to check that one place that might not even have what you need? Please don&apos;t make me.
<br>
<br>So why play the game? No reason. I&apos;m not even sure why I finished it. I&apos;m only reviewing it because it somehow had a 73 on Metacritic according to Steam, and that is just horribly misleading for some poor people who might considering buying it.

<br>It is an homage to Zelda, but is empty in a lot of sense and is just not on that level.</span>

<br>
<br>The core gameplay is very familiar to Zelda fans &#x2013; you have a sword and a shield. You wander around stabbing stuff. While the game has 3D graphics, it is fundamentally 2D &#x2013; indeed, it is a major gameplay mechanic that you can fall down one &#x201C;floor&#x201D; worth of blocks, and can only go up via stairs. This is pretty much how all the dungeons are arranged, and numerous puzzles center around your inability to jump.
<br>
<br>This is not a sophisticated game &#x2013; you walk around and slash stuff with your sword. There is no Z-targeting or anything of the sort, but the game does have a sort of auto-aim feature.
<br>
<br>Over the course of the game, you acquire items &#x2013; bombs (for blowing stuff up), a bow and arrow (for shooting targets to trigger stuff, as well as certain enemies), a fishing rod (because what is Zelda without fishing?), boots (for jumping over one-square gaps)&#x2026; really, exactly the most basic items you&#x2019;d expect in a Zelda game. You also get spells &#x2013; a fire spell, a spell that drops stuff on switches, an ice spell to freeze stuff which seemed unnecessary, a cure spell that I only used on the final boss, and a black hole spell that is super overpowered but useless on bosses.
<br>
<br>That said, the game is pretty easy, and the puzzles basic. There&#x2019;s nothing here that you haven&#x2019;t seen before many times.
<br>
<br>And that&#x2019;s really the problem with the game &#x2013; it is nothing new. It is just a kind of mediocre Zelda-ish game that doesn&#x2019;t do anything new, just sort of treads the usual ground. The bosses are nothing impressive, the ordinary enemies are mostly boring and samey (and you find them a lot &#x2013; there isn&#x2019;t a whole bunch of variety, having even less variety than Zelda games), the environments didn&#x2019;t feel that varied (you&#x2019;re on a bunch of islands, but few of them feel unique)&#x2026; really, there&#x2019;s just very little here to excite you.
<br>
<br>It isn&#x2019;t bad, and the voice acting is decent (even if the script is often not great), but there&#x2019;s just little here to get excited about. You&#x2019;ve probably played Zelda, and if you haven&#x2019;t, this isn&#x2019;t a great introduction to the genre &#x2013; games like Darksiders felt like they were much more interesting new interpretations of the Zelda formula than this was. This was same old, same old, and fairly mediocre. There&#x2019;s nothing great about it, and while it isn&#x2019;t bad, there&#x2019;s little to recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6291419">Expand</a></span>

<br>A Great Adventure
<br>Ocean Horn is a Legend of Zelda Styled Adventure Game where you play as a boy who finds his father has left to slay the oceanhorn..
<br>You then set out on an adventure to help him...
<br>The gameplay and level design is quite simple&#x2026;
<br>You have a sword, shield and magic&#x2026;
<br>Before you can defeat the oceanhorn you must find the emblems of the Earth Ocean and sun
<br>and to get to these locations you need information&#x2026;
<br>You run around each island looking for new information to send you to the next&#x2026; this is a bit of a goose chase&#x2026; and such an enjoyable goose chase
<br>As you run around there will be enemies trying to stop you, treasure to collect, bloodstone to find&#x2026; new equipment and magic to help you in other locations&#x2026;
<br>Spots you can&#x2019;t get to yet&#x2026;
<br>There is such a great feeling of discovery here&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s so fun to explore and figure out how to get to different areas&#x2026;
<br>Leave an island to search for a different item to reach an area you can&#x2019;t quite get to&#x2026;
<br>This treasure collecting and environmental puzzle solving is the majority of the game&#x2026;
<br>Its 12 hours of the same thing from start to finish, but the pacing here is so well balanced that it never gets tiring.. there&#x2019;s a perfect balance between adventure, combat, and problem solving&#x2026;
<br>When it is finally time to go after one of the 3 emblems, there is a boss there guarding it&#x2026;
<br>And this unfortunately is when the bad of the game starts to show&#x2026;
<br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong... I loved the bosses in this game&#x2026;
<br>They are challenging in their own way&#x2026;
<br>But the mechanics of the actual game hinders this otherwise great experience&#x2026;
<br>For starters... the camera is atrocious, especially during the ocean emblem boss battle&#x2026;
<br>The camera will lock onto the boss, cause the camera to go underneath your character, in front of your character, to the side&#x2026;.  Instead of sticking with you&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;d much rather let the boss run around and do his thing while I set up to take him out&#x2026;
<br>It adds an unnecessary layer of frustration to an already tough to deal with situation&#x2026;
<br>Another annoyance I have here is that when you do die... which you will, a lot&#x2026;
<br>Your inventory of bombs, arrows, mana, and health does restore&#x2026;
<br>The health is the biggest slap in the face as no matter how many heart containers you&#x2019;ve found, if you die you respawn with only 3 health&#x2026; witch btw only takes one hit from a bomb in the 2nd to last boss battle to kill you&#x2026; Sure there are tricks like going out of the room to break containers for drops, but it&#x2019;s an annoying hassle to have to go out and manually restock your items and health&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s like you did so great the first time when you died going in with full health magic, and 10 bombs, try again with 33% of your health no magic and no bombs
<br>And to make it worse, despite the game remembering the progress of your item usage.. It completely forgets the damage you did to the boss&#x2026;
<br>He gets to start full health&#x2026;
<br>Garbage rules and camera aside
<br>Each and every boss fight is enjoyable and insanely satisfying when you take that punk down&#x2026;
<br>Ocean Horn is a great game&#x2026;
<br>So much adventure, so much content&#x2026;
<br>I couldn&#x2019;t put it down&#x2026;
<br>I give Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6691918">Expand</a></span>

When games are made on tighter budgets we tend to only expect them to look so good or play so smoothly.  With Oceanhorn we have a beautiful 3D world with excellent gameplay inspired straight from the best Zelda games.  Clever puzzles, wonderful dungeons, and a grand sense of exploration put this game right on par with the triple-A games that influence it.  That may be hard to believe but I&apos;ll try to convince you in detail... or better yet just go check it.
<br>
<br>Honestly, I never grew up playing too many of the Zelda games.  That being said the protagonist, running around with his sword and shield, fits right into Link&apos;s archetype.  Oceanhorn, not only in looks but in gameplay, fits right in with the likes of Wind Waker or Link to the Past.  You progress from one island (dungeon) to the next gaining new abilities and weapons that will allow you to access to more and more areas.  These classic weapons include bombs and a bow as well as magic, such as the ability to summon fire and ice.  You can even find heart containers, four of which will increase your maximum health.
<br>
<br>As you explore these islands you&apos;ll have numerous puzzles to solve and enemies to slice down, including bosses.  The level design is phenomenal, prompting exploration and keeping you excited to see whats next.  The puzzles never get too challenging but many of them will make you stop and think.  The enemies aren&apos;t too challenging either but between them and the traps you can find yourself low on health pretty quickly.  The bosses mix things up a bit, usually requiring a particular sequence of events to inflict damage.  This game isn&apos;t supposed to be difficult, its designed so that gamers of all ages and skill levels can explore a big world and go on an exciting adventure.
<br>
<br>Oceanhorn has a solid story but its just not particularly exciting.  That is not to say that the story takes away from what is otherwise a superb experience, it still helps give you a sense of purpose.  You wake up to find your father has left you because of the threat poised by Oceanhorn.  Oceanhorn is a monster consider to be a living fortress, a machine with a soul, that haunts the world around you.  As you start to explore you&apos;ll hear your father reminisce, via your journal, commenting on the history of each island.  On occasion there are other little cut-scenes with different characters to emphasize the importance of your journey or give you a brief history lesson.  Besides the stuff with your father much of it is forgettable but it all helps to ground the game and make the world believable.
<br>
<br>Clocking in at a solid 10 hours there certainly isn&apos;t much to complain about.  Sure the story is a little cliche but thats not why you&apos;ll be playing Oceanhorn.   This game is all about going on a grand adventure, finding new abilities and items that give you a wonderful sense of progression.  Never knowing whats around the corner or in the next room will keep you absorbed throughout your entire journey.  For such a straight-forward action/adventure game Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is surprising polished and well designed.  If you ever needed an excuse to jump into the indie scene, or convince your friends to do so, this is a good place to start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oceanhorn-monster-of-uncharted-seas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6896876">Expand</a></span>
