I think the story is fun and very BSG-esq though I wish it were fleshed out a little more and explained for instance why my friendly capital ship is always outmatched.  There are a few bugs however, they don&apos;t break the game by any means but they are noticeable, mostly collision issues (I&apos;ve found I can&apos;t actually crash my ship and enemy ships can fly into stations and ships with impunity). On the whole however I&apos;d say that SOL: Exodus is worth the 10 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sol-exodus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2116180">Expand</a></span>

You made a great looking product, and controls are simplistic enough to not scare away those that do not want to get into a full fledged simulation.<br><br>I&apos;ll write more up later as I get a chance to play more, and I&apos;m hoping I have a Eureka moment that will either immerse me or &quot;click&quot; as to why I&apos;m not feeling the fun factor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sol-exodus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2114815">Expand</a></span>

I found both control schemes easy to use, and fun to play. My only complaint would be that the radar can be hard to understand sometimes. The developers seem to be listening and responding to community complaints though, and I believe they are planning on releasing a patch to address that. All in all, this game is a blast, especially for $10.
