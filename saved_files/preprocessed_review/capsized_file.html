When combined, those two qualities give a nice, atmospheric feel to the game and you do truly feel like you&apos;re on another planet. I also enjoyed the impressive arsenal of weaponry that the player can use throughout the game, as each weapon was unique and interesting. The enemies were somewhat diverse and interesting as well. Having said all that, why a score of 7? Well, despite these impressive qualities, Capsized has a few noticeable downfalls. First and foremost are the controls. Most of the time it was impossible to actually -control- the playable character the way you wanted to. Whenever you moved, it seemed like he&apos;d always glide, slide, or float away. I know the setting is a planet with a low gravity, but still, when I want him to stop, I expect him to stop, otherwise moving around and especially aiming at the enemies becomes a nightmare. And yes, aiming was already tricky to begin with since the crosshair&apos;s sensitivity is strange and some of the time it blends in with the background, so you don&apos;t even see where you&apos;re shooting until you start seeing your bullets fly out of your gun. I tried to play with a gamepad as well, but that doesn&apos;t make it any easier. Another issue I want to tackle is concerning the gameplay. I noticed the difficulty was a bit unbalanced. The first 2-3 levels were really easy and then suddenly on the next level after that the difficulty goes way up. Most of the challenge seemed to involve you taking a step into a wide open area only to suddenly be swarmed by dozens of enemies from all sides, one of which would always grab you and drag you to another corner of the map, making sure to aggravate every other enemy on the map in the process. I admit that can be fun at times, especially if you want to mess around and see how many enemies you can kill before they grind you into pieces, but that doesn&apos;t really translate to a good gameplay. And lastly I&apos;ll also mention that for some unknown reason the game crashes when I try to load the final level. Everything worked perfectly and the game played fine in the first 11 stages, but the last stage consistently crashes to desktop whenever I try to play it. I checked for some fixes online, and I saw that there were other people who had the same issue as well, but so far no solutions whatsoever. Overall Capsized is not a bad game. It&apos;s well worth a try, because it does not fail to deliver on the fun aspect (even if it is short lived), and apart from the campaign, there are also other features, such as deathmatch against bots, and so on (although you have to unlock those features by doing well on the campaign), but despite having a good presentation and basics of gameplay, there is nothing much else to the game. If you&apos;re expecting miracles or hours of gameplay, you won&apos;t find them here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=2856679">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are physics based and are not exceptionally challenging, the combat is robust and the selection of hi-tech weapons are fun to use, each with their own different alternate fire mode. Power ups and secrets scattered throughout the levels change the game significantly, from a swarm of nanites that attack onscreen enemies, to anti-grav boost, or a super shield that provides invulnerability to non-self inflicted attacks to regenerating jetpack fuel.<br><br>The enemies are also diverse and often camouflaged as part of the scenery making it even more surprising when they leap out at you. Levels where you navigate alien tombs filled with Indiana Jones-esque traps are exciting, and the spore levels where the gravity is much lighter keep things enjoyably fresh. It&apos;s a short game (maybe 5-6hrs tops) but encourages multiple playthroughs to attain better scores on each level and achievement unlocks. You can also play it co-op - which is a rarity these days and there are a variety of modes including death match, survival and others for those that want it.<br><br>I didn&apos;t get much replay value out of it personally, but it left a strong impression on me. It&apos;s a cheap game, well worth the $10 USD it normally sells for, even for a single playthrough. The developers have made a solid game that is short and sweet, if the developers released DLC in the form of a level pack or more challenges, I would definitely purchase them. But their core product proves that less is more, and by not over-complicating things you can get noticed and make an impression. Buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691743">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Only made an metacritic account because of the final stage of this game. It&apos;s final boss it&apos;s absolutelly ridiculous. It feels like they didn&apos;t play it themselves. First of all, the &quot;no gravity&quot; factor it&apos;s cool, but the whole game you been trying to master the maneuverability of your character and that counts for NOTHING on the final level/boss. The scenary you are at is also not suitable for a boss fight of this proportion. The dude is huge and the place doesn&apos;t give you space enough to try and dodge his attacks been forced to either throw em back or wasting your flamethrower&apos;s secondary fire. Also, he &quot;hides&quot; behind the maps structure, where you cannot hit him. He just stops there and start spaming minions and, btw, that is the only time you can actually do damage to him (on the second creature that is). The last form/creature exploding projectile is a bad taste joke. You can&apos;t barelly pick it up, he is already tossing another one at you.
<br>
<br>Okay, overall, I had fun. The 3 first stages are bloody easy, and then it suddenly got realy hard. It&apos;s ok, I like hard games, i&apos;m a battletoads fan, but, Capsized makes me feel like, doesn&apos;t matter what I do, I will need luck to beat the final boss, not skill. It&apos;s hard to say good things abuout this game been so mad at it as I am right now, but it deserves some credict on a phew aspects. The enviroment is AMAZING, Until you get used to the surroundings, you start shotting everything that moves, &apos;cause everthing feels hostile in this planet. Which is good in my opinion, because, well, it&apos;s an unkown alien planet, it SHOULD feel that unpredictable. The music is also cool, although after a while I got tired of it, I think it might please most of the people who play the game.
<br>Weapons, well, they are cool and I can&apos;t say that they don&apos;t serve different purposes, but I used the first weapon through most of the game (it&apos;s secondary fire is amazing).
<br>
<br>Well, it&apos;s an nice game on the visuals, but kinda &quot;ok&quot; on the gameplay on my vision. One thing I am sure of: I am NEVER EVER buying a game from Alien Trap again because of that enerving boss fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018041">Expand</a></span>

Cool ideas for weapons and power-ups. Physics are fun at first but became awkward pretty quickly. Forgot to use the jet-pack half the time, didn&apos;t really need it with such low gravity
<br>Controls were difficult to get used to.
<br>
<br>FINAL LEVEL WAS RIDICULOUS.
<br>
<br>Didn&apos;t complete the game because of it. Maybe I&apos;m just not good enough, either way it took away from the experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231104">Expand</a></span>

The hand-drawn environments show a sense of care to 2D games that only a few other devs have matched (Braid). It is very rare to feel like you have been drawn in rather than just watching your character do things on the screen, but the Alientrap devs have gone above and beyond this. The short little tutorial at the beginning is straightforward and controls are easy to grasp after a little practice. Sometimes the controls can be a little tough if you aren&apos;t quite used to them yet, though they become second nature in time. The game introduces new elements very straightforwardly, allowing you to figure out what they do on their own rather than telling you, which keeps the element of discovery fresh in every level. They use this same concept for the enemies.<br><br>The level design is great, providing secrets like in retro 2Ders to discover which will give you a buff or extra life. There is no map or compass, adding to the genuine &quot;Lost and stranded&quot; theme of the game.<br><br>If this wasn&apos;t enough to convince you to grab it, go check the demo out on Steam!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=1603670">Expand</a></span>

This game is a simple sidescroller - nothing more unfortunately, even if you factor in the physics engine.  Weapon system is awkward - why make it so hard to choose a weapon?  Unlike BRAID - this game is just a sidescroller with pretty graphics.</span>

None of the &quot;fixes&quot; on the Steam and developer forums have helped at all and the developer seems to have given up on this well-known issue.

Despite that very serious bug, Capsized manages to charm with its artwork and action packed levels. It is of adequate length, without getting too repetitive. The physics of the game, in addition to the artwork is also a memorable highlight in this indie title. It took me about 6 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=1720462">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. Enemies relative to your surroundings - Look how long I played this game. At the time of me typing this, it was 26m. In 26m, I felt so incredibly disoriented whenever I had an enemy near me in side of a wall or a cave in a fairly dark place, and yes, WITH THE FLASHLIGHT ON, and I could never see where they are due to foreground objects of them looking just like the scenery. It&apos;s not fair to have tiny enemies with giant foreground aesthetic bullcrap covering them! There are also plenty of ranged enemies that get an unfair shot at you before you even know they&apos;re there and give you no time to react to a shot coming from seemingly nowhere. It&apos;s ridiculous!
<br>
<br>2. The controls - The enemies were one thing, but the controls is the sole reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone, and the main reason being that you have 3 &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Ascend&quot; commands. You have &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, and &quot;Jetpack&quot;. One thing to keep in mind for game design is that &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; are NOT the same command, yet unfortunately for me, Alientrap Games disagrees. So, when I&apos;m trying to, say, go up in a manner that doesn&apos;t involve jumping, I obviously hold up (the original jump control, which I mapped to spacebar, along with the Jetpack), only to realize, oh right, jump and up are the same button. The jetpack is another thing that&apos;s an absolute mess because typically in games, jetpack is a form of &quot;secondary jump&quot; or activates from a &quot;double jump&quot;. Having it be its own button is very awkward, so I set it to jump. Alright, no biggie. Every time I want to jump or use the jetpack, it&apos;s just the same button now. But no! The fact that Up and Jump are the same button not only makes me use jetpack fuel every time I want to go up or jump, but also does the reverse when I just want to jetpack lightly, I&apos;ll go rocketing upward because it makes me jump when I&apos;m too close to the ground, and if jump isn&apos;t mapped to the jetpack, the entire control scheme feels incredibly awkward.
<br>
<br>A dishonorable mention I&apos;d like to finish my negative review on is the jetpack itself. Level 1, you&apos;re given a jetpack that has unlimited fuel, but can only be used in short bursts then needs to recharge. Completely understandable and a good mechanic, but, oh wait, now I start level 2 and I have no jetpack? Oh, I find jetpack fuel and... ... it doesn&apos;t replenish...? WHY would you introduce a &quot;recharging&quot; jetpack mechanic in level 1 if in the VERY next level (that didn&apos;t pull a Metroid Prime of &quot;you lost your jetpack&quot;) would you make me need to continuously collect fuel?! That&apos;s so stupid! I don&apos;t know if you get an unlimited jetpack later, and frankly, I don&apos;t care. If you do, it cancels out this last paragraph, but it&apos;s downright insane to introduce &quot;recharging&quot; to immediately say &quot;lol jk now collect fuel&quot;.
<br>
<br>Now onto the positives: The atmosphere and visuals are absolutely beautiful and stylized. Similar to Metroid, you really get the feel that you&apos;re alone on this alien planet looking for your crew (at least that&apos;s what I got from playing 4 levels). Honestly, when I wasn&apos;t getting screwed by the aesthetics with enemies blending into it, I was stunned by how gorgeous it looked. On top of that, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to and further emphasizes that you&apos;re on some uncharted alien planet, full of vegetation and whatnot.
<br>
<br>Overall score, I&apos;d have to give it a 4, which is for the gameplay, music, and visuals, while the controls and blending-into-the-scenary-enemies cuts down a lot of points. If the controls weren&apos;t half-broken, I&apos;d probably give it around an 8, give or take the 7-9 range depending on what&apos;s to come. Sadly, because the controls feel so crippled, I&apos;ll never know what&apos;s coming up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=4334403">Expand</a></span>

This is only hampered by a few moments of frustration where precision is required of the player than the system can provide. Level design, these moments aside, is solid, although secret areas could have been handled better. Finding entrances to these requires exhaustively shooting walls over a wide area.
<br>
<br>The structure is interesting in that equipment is crucial but none carries over between levels, making each a mini exploration quest of its own.
<br>
<br>The hand-drawn backgrounds impress, while the game graphics underwhelm with poor animation &amp; visibility issues. In presentation, the soundtrack really shines, succeeding better than any other aspect at keeping up the pace.
<br>
<br>Combat is fun where aggression is rewarded &amp; thus it integrates smoothly with locomotion, but in places where more caution is required, the enemies&apos; own lack of aggression shows. The AI is negligible: flying enemies don&apos;t pathfind, getting stuck behind walls more often than not; an enemy with LOS to the player stands in one spot shooting forever; enemies routinely kill each other with friendly fire  as more an oversight than actual mechanic.
<br>
<br>Overall a decent little package, with emphasis on &quot;little&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=3296833">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is almost absent and the game is extremely short.

Maybe it&apos;s more fun to try and get 10 stars (basically S rank) per level but I&apos;m definitely not trying that. The enemies blend in with the background and level too which can be very frustrating. I would say it&apos;s worth to play if you get it almost free, and since that&apos;s how much it costs I would say it&apos;s worth a play.

<br>Pros: Nice art, nice controls, very cheap
<br>Cons: Terrible enemy design, terrible level design, very short</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/capsized/user-reviews?user_review_id=6875319">Expand</a></span>
