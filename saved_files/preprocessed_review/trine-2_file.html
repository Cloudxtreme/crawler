Technically everything works perfectly alright and the gameplay is overall decent. The problem however is that the gameplay is really to simple and to recognizable. Puzzles is basically you levitating stuff to get to shiny balls in the air and if you are aiming for a complete playthrough that is what you are going to be doing the majority of the time, and after a while it gets to be a chore. The upgrade system doesn&apos;t really motivate you either since its pretty basic stuff you unlock. Now the combat and platforming works well enough but is hardly challenging and its pretty standard. Now i might seem a little negative here but the gameplay is simply alright and not great and that is a shame considering how visually pleasing it looks and how talented the developer seem to be. Still if you expect a beautiful standard platformer you wont be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576277">Expand</a></span>

You finally get to fight more enemies than skeletons everywhere, and the puzzles are way more interesting than in it&apos;s predecessor. The multiplayer got improved, too. Hooking up with your friends via Steam or playing local works smooth and easy.<br>Trine isn&apos;t faultless though. Some switches for example are really hard to see, since they blend in well with the background, or appear in very dark corners. The animations often end abruptly or look clunky. This doesn&apos;t change the otherwise fluent game-play for worse though.<br><br>All in all, Trine 2 is a game worth looking into, and highly recommended for playing cooperatively.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2291424">Expand</a></span>

It connects the 2D view with amazing 3D objects and great lights, wich create a great atmosphere. The puzzles remind me of Portal, wich had a great Leveldesign. All in all it is a way to easy when you play with your freinds. But it is still a great Indie game.</span>

It improves every aspect of the first game by a long shot. I thought it was going to be mostly like the original but there&apos;s just a lot more depth to it, and it looks so much better now. The original looks great too, but this...it&apos;s incredible how a solid art style can make a game look so beautiful. On top of the visuals, growing plants using a dynamic stream of water never gets old (and there&apos;s so much more to the puzzles than that). It&apos;s just so involving and intuitive while being simple. The narrative isn&apos;t overdone and it&apos;s intriguing despite it being almost like a children&apos;s book. The banter amongst the heroes keeps you interested in the actual story while you play, just like in the original Trine. A game like this doesn&apos;t come around often in my opinion, especially for only 15 USD. That&apos;s an amazing price for an amazing game. Lastly, the game runs BEAUTIFULLY smooth. I have everything set to the highest setting at 1080p resolution with some anti-aliasing and I get super smooth frame rates on my outdated computer (GTS 250, Core2Duo E6400, 3gb DDR2 RAM). This game doesn&apos;t need a lot of AA to make edges look nice either. It just looks so amazing yet it runs so perfectly. I really have to give my respect to Frozenbyte, they&apos;ve outdone themselves yet again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2007567">Expand</a></span>

The maps are varied, the monsters look incredible and it combines puzzles and combat really seamlessly. For a quarter of the price of a full retail game this is an absolute steal.</span>

Combat, movement, and gameplay in general are fluid and intuitive. Puzzles, especially reaching the optional experience orbs, are extremely satisfying. The art style, music, and atmosphere create an immersive fairy-tale-like world.</span>

While many games have level variety, switching from city to jungle to ice plains to deserts, only few of them have in-level variety of the magnitude Trine 2 has: Here, you may start at the outskirts of a forest, and without a level load, progress into dark spider-infested caves; or you begin at a sunlit beach and before the level is over, there&apos;s a thunderstorm with massive waves, from which you seek shelter in a ruined castle.<br><br>Seldom do I use the word beautiful, but it&apos;s impossible to express the visuals of Trine 2 with any other word. Trine 2 basically defines a new category of visuals, all for itself. While some games are stylized, and other games are realistic, Trine 2 is beautiful. Colors are so saturated that anything more would be &quot;too much&quot;; depth of the maps is astonishing -- while you focus on what&apos;s happening at the front, the background is alive and oftentimes, others in the room will exclaim something like &quot;Look! Back there! Do you see it! Wow!&quot;<br><br>As great as the graphics are also the sounds and music. Normally, the music is slower and gentle, but as soon as enemies appear, it quickly changes into a battle mode music, which lasts until the last enemy is slain. Superb are the voice-overs; the heroes are dubbed with great care, while the voices of goblins and other monsters deliver both threat and humor (&quot;Do you think we&apos;ll have to fight them?&quot; asks a goblin...)<br><br>The game controls are very intuitive thanks to the combination of mouse aiming and keyboard movement.<br><br>But the core of every game is its gameplay, and so, the rest of this review will be about how it plays.<br><br>Trine 2 plays great and is entertaining from start to finish. Developers are offering well-paced and balanced mix of 3 elements: Exploration, Combat, and Puzzles. The separation of battles by traveling and puzzles makes sure that you will not be battle-fatigued, and also allows the game to regularly catch you off-guard (my wife at least tends to be ambushed almost every single time, as she forgots to switch to the Knight when moving forward). The exploration aspect is, in a way, similar to Half-Life 2, where quite often, you have several paths opening before you, but if you select &quot;the wrong one&quot;, you will quickly come to its end, perhaps finding a treasure, and so there&apos;s not much backtracking. Plus, it seems that optional sections are intentionally significantly harder, thus signalling &quot;You don&apos;t have to go here if you don&apos;t feel like it&quot;. It makes the rewards at the end ever more rewarding.<br><br>Combat has been improved by orders of magnitude from Trine 1 by 3 things:<br>1. The main fighting force of the enemy, green goblins, are now equipped with spears, which can be thrown or used for stabbing and smashing, so they have ways of attacking you from a distance as well as up close. This solved one of the flaws of original Trine, where players often sniped skeletons from afar without fear of retribution.<br>2. Ambush system, where enemies are not idly waiting in the map, but rather hide in the background of the level, and jump to the front when the player is well-positioned. This produces enemies all around the player for increased challenge, without being &quot;unfair&quot; (like the teleporting demons in Doom 3 are)<br>3. Enemy variations, with significantly more enemy types than the original. While the original only had skeletons, spiders and bats, here you will face goblins, trolls, demons, spiders and some more, which I&apos;m not going to spoil.<br><br>Puzzles are vastly improved with the addition of fluids and steam. You will find yourself creating irrigation lines, combining steam pipes to fix broken steam systems, and finding counterbalances. But some enemies require puzzle approach as well, simply because they cannot be killed, and must instead be tricked or avoided.<br>Already during the Beta, many public testers were reporting that puzzles may sometimes be &quot;short-circuited&quot; by using wizard to &quot;self-levitate&quot;. In the end, developers decided to leave this option in, so remember, if you&apos;re completely stuck on a puzzle and it requires you to get over some obstacle or gap, your last resort is always self-levitation (which is not easy to do, so it won&apos;t happen by accident). Hardcore gamers may impose self-regulating limit on themselves to force them to be creative.<br><br>As I&apos;m writing this, I&apos;m also looking at the community forums on Steampowered.com, and see a prime example of the creative genius of this game: Players are discussing how to solve certain puzzle at Level 3, and there are already 4 totally different solutions to it listed. How many other games do you know where each puzzle has multiple solutions?<br><br>To sum it up -- Trine 2 is an amazing game and is accessible to hardcore as well as casual players. I can recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2011170">Expand</a></span>

Solid game play, music and tight controls make it a blast to play with friends, like the first one except better because now you can play online! Also hey, some gorgeous graphics here. For only $15 how could I not give this a 10 when it provides so much? An instant classic, like Bastion, you need this in your collection.</span>

If that alone doesn&apos;t convince you, the coop mode and the price (13 Euros / Steam) should do. Demo now available on Steam!</span>

<br>
<br>Graphic style captivates the depth of color, clever use of elements of physics give the game an appropriate character.
<br>The game is just great.</span>

The graphics are amazing, even better than in the good looking first Trine. More variety in the puzzles and even in the landscape make this game one of the best experiences I had this year. And I&apos;ve still got to play the cooperative mode.</span>

Storytelling is marvelous and the soundtrack is as beautiful as the game itself, it is a must have if you like a coop game with a great graphics, great story and so much of fun. The price you pay for this game is incredibly low for what you are getting.</span>

As with the first Trine my issue with this game is the complete lack of challenge which inevitably leads to apathy and boredom. Any of the &quot;puzzles&quot; can be skipped by abusing the wizard&apos;s box mechanic. I have done approximately no puzzles the right way. I have passed all the levels in 5 minutes after after an hour I was done with Trine 2. That is to say, it&apos;s a casual game for people who are bad at games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825613">Expand</a></span>

We played several hours straight, the same happened the next day - and we have already planned another session tonight. Seriously people, if you like platforming or co-op this is most certainly the game for you. It is polished, controls well on the keyboard without a controller, breath-taking colorful graphics and really good physics puzzles which makes you and your friends stop and think for a little while every now and again. A really good game. A breath of fresh air.

A well-designed level has a denouement or &quot;eureka!&quot; moment, where the whole design of the level makes sense, when the solution is revealed. Trine, instead, is about stacking blocks. Climb and repeat. That&apos;s basically it. I wonder what people would rate this game if we simplified the artwork, and just consider the game-play mechanics. It&apos;s unfortunate that so little work went into puzzle design. Finally, this game is nothing like Lost Vikings. Vikings had great denouement moments in each level; that was a puzzle-design masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2021347">Expand</a></span>

<br>this is after all a descendant of Lost Vikings from the SNES, while there is more diversity of play it doesn&apos;t make it more interesting or imaginative. Nonetheless this is a decent time waster, and in a AAA industry its hard not to gravitate toward it.

                                        <span>not the biggest fan of how i basically have to cheat every puzzle. i manage to beat them but know i never did them correctly, but i cant be that angry at a game which looks this beautiful. seriously impressive graphically but i thought the gameplay was a little lackluster. still mild enjoyable and worth a reccomendation</span>

In terms of gameplay, I found it fairly flat and really inferior to &apos;proper&apos; puzzle games. It seems promising at the start as it introduces cool concepts like pipes and growing plants but it doesn&apos;t really seem to develop from there. It seemed like 90% of the puzzles just required you to hit a switch and/or levitate yourself over a ledge at the right time. Admittedly, I might have just been doing it wrong but I played with my friend and we couldn&apos;t figure out the &apos;proper&apos; solutions if there were any other than just levitating across. In this regard, as my friend was playing the mage I found the game very simple as he did all the levitating and pipe twisting and throwing whereas I just had to occasionally stand in a particular spot and wait, or kill the generic goblin-type mobs by spam clicking the mouse. Additionally, as it&apos;s not particularly cheap for an indie game, it felt a bit too short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559026">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797175">Expand</a></span>

<br>I loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.
<br>
<br>Now, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they &quot;suggest&quot; what to do to make them harder.
<br>
<br>To sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this. I strongly suggest you to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588219">Expand</a></span>

Just as the first one, Trine 2 is absolutely stunning visually and music-wise. There was no problem there at all. The gameplay is very similar as well - you go through a number of levels, fight monsters, and solve puzzles, and you do this with all 3 characters at once, being able to swap between them at any time in order to tackle the next obstacle. The Wizard can conjure and levitate objects, the Thief can shoot arrows and swing via a grappling hook, and the Knight can fight up close and also use his shield to protect against the environmental hazards. I generally liked the levels, especially the Searock Castle, and the story (even though it wasn&apos;t the focus of the game). The dialogues between the characters were really funny too and added charm to the game. The only thing that sort of annoyed me was how Trine 2 took a complete favour towards co-op play and left the solo players behind. The reason I say this is because most of the game&apos;s puzzles were clearly designed for co-op play. There were solutions for solo players as well, but those were usually very frustrating to execute and at times even required trial and error ways. Usually solving a hard puzzle in games leaves you feeling great afterwards, but I didn&apos;t feel that satisfaction with many of the Trine 2 puzzles. Another problem with puzzles was that at times they expected you to have a certain skill already, like the Wizard&apos;s plank, and if you didn&apos;t, then you simply had to remove points from another skill and use in the one you need. So in essence there is no freedom to choose which skills you want to get. So that was a bit of a rant, and hence if you&apos;re looking to only play this game solo, then my score would probably be 8, but with co-op it is as good as 9. Generally I thought the gameplay has improved over the first in some aspects and worsened in other aspects, but overall if you don&apos;t count the fact that Trine 2 made co-op over online, the first game to me was superior. There was more satisfaction smashing the skeletons into pieces in Trine 1 than simply hitting the goblins in Trine 2. And Thief&apos;s grappling hook is a lot less useful now than in the first game because it seems that many of the surfaces in most levels cannot be grappled, hence making the grappling hook useless. However, Trine 2 did add some awesome abilities, such as Knight&apos;s hammer throw and Wizard being able to levitate the enemies now. Trine 2 also has a longer story mode than the first, but I am willing to bet the extra length is from spending more time on puzzle solutions rather than actual content. Generally Trine 2 is a great game. It&apos;s just I found it to be a bit too frustrating to the point that I wanted to rip my own hair compared to the first and hence the overall experience was not as pleasant on the first playthrough. I&apos;d still highly recommend both games. They are fantastic and are among best indie games out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549175">Expand</a></span>

For example, players can be any character even if another player is already playing that character, or change settings so only one player can be a specific character at a time. Also you can go from being able to levitate yourself, to only an ally, to not able to at all, which I saw was a complaint on a lower score, which seems to me they just wanted to complain. The difficulty setting is extremely customizable, from you could be half asleep to win, to you may quit cause of how difficult it got. My only complaint of this game, is the short scenes that you cannot skip, this is my biggest complaint for any game and has ruined a lot of games for me. Cut scenes are great... just not 100 times over right after a spawn spot where I die a thousand times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2292797">Expand</a></span>

In stereoscopic 3D, this is the most beautiful game I have ever seen! For the first three levels I spent most of the time just standing around looking at the props. The narrator and voice acting are charming and the puzzles, while nothing revolutionary, are fun. The controls are well-designed but they neglect to inform you that the magician can rotate an object with left/right (A/D) so I developed other ways to rotate objects with the environment for most of the game. I haven&apos;t played multiplayer yet, but single-player is good enough for a 10 in my opinion. People that don&apos;t like the game because they can cheat with the magician are foolish: just don&apos;t cheat! It&apos;s more fun that way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2618570">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&#x2014; Characters are fleshed out in a very light way. You get a quick background on their reasons to do whatever they are/want to do and that&#x2019;s it. While this could be a negative point, you don&#x2019;t really need to know more than what is told to you, and from then on the plot develops over the course of the game and through their dialogue, which is pretty nice. You get just the right amount of information to be able to enjoy the characters and their misadventures.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Characters are rather overpowered in the first game, thanks to the inventory system, allowing you to equip up to 9 artefacts to each character, improving stats or giving them health boosts (or outright giving them a second life). There is also the fact that each character has 3 ranks on their spells, and Amadeus in particular can summon more than twice the number of objects in the first game when compared to the second, including floating platforms which make it easy to bypass obstacles or reach difficult places. In the second game you have to use several skills from the three characters in combination to achieve the same results, making it more enjoyable.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Oh my god, the visuals. Every plant, leaf, statue, EVERYTHING looks absolutely wonderful. And don&#x2019;t even get me started on some of the bosses or goblins in the second game. I don&#x2019;t think I ever took as many screenshots per minute as I did in the Trine games. Back when these games came out in 2009 and 2011 respectively, playing on Extreme settings with a good framerate required a pretty solid rig. But seeing as my four year old GTX670 can keep it capped pretty much all of the time, it&#x2019;s not a stretch anymore.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Occasional oddity in character physics, game has its quirks.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Amadeus is kind of useless in boss fights. He&apos;s a wizard that can summon boxes and move objects, meaning his offensive skills are non-existent.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Having to make movements with the cursor to summon different objects can be a headache and make the game unnecessarily hard on higher difficulties. It would have been easier to just press a specific button for each object (there are only 3 different objects anyways, 2 in the second game). Making said movements with a controller using the analog stick takes even longer than with a mouse and might get annoying after a while. In addition, the speed at which you can levitate certain objects (due to their weight) is painfully slow.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Everything is intuitive and makes sense, puzzles are relatively easy to solve by using simple logic or by just paying attention to your surroundings. Obviously, you&apos;ll have to solve them faster on harder difficulties if you don&#x2019;t want to get killed. It certainly wouldn&apos;t have hurt to have harder puzzles, though that would probably have made certain achievements close to impossible, such as completing levels using only one single character.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Voice acting is wonderful, for some reason I can&#x2019;t put my finger on. Characters seem genuinely friendly and trustful towards each other, except for the first couple of levels in the first game. Characters (especially Amadeus) have a lot of emotion behind them so it&#x2019;s easy for the player to empathize with them, and all dialogue sounds natural and flows well. The narrator is nice too.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Music is very fitting and relaxing. Goes with the beautiful art and keeps you calm and focused.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: relaxing and fun gameplay, nice music, friendly characters and astounding visuals. If you want a nice co-op experience, go for it. If you want a good single-player experience, go for it too. Especially if you like platformers, puzzles, fantasy games and beautiful scenery.
<br>
<br>Final Gameplay Stats:
<br>
<br>Trine: 11 Hours played, 33 / 33 Achievements (100%)
<br>Trine 2: 55 Hours played, 97 / 97 Achievements (100%)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5249104">Expand</a></span>

Greatly improves the sound section, where even the soundtrack and dialogue highlights the characters is much more complete. There are many new skills in addition to the previous game, many new types of highly original puzzle. The boss fights come alive (Before they were almost nil) and make a very epic (giant snakes or dragons, with all the detail and quite spectacular).

The varying ability of the three characters to defend themselves or move around the screen leads to lots of funny, entertaining and cool co-op play. It also has a nice little story, a great fairy-tale aesthetic and truly beautiful graphics that seem to be optimised brilliantly - it ran really well even on my fairly crappy PC. It could perhaps use a couple more Lost Vikings-style ways to &apos;combine your powers&apos; but that&apos;s my only real (half-hearted) criticism. Easily worth a score in the low to mid 90s out of 100 using a &apos;50 is average&apos; scale, so I&apos;ll give it 10 on here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805587">Expand</a></span>

However, it is a huge ton of rinse and repeat in this game, which made me frankly quite bored and unimpressed halfway through, the collectables are garbage and exploring in this game is not rewarding. Still a decent game.</span>

The original Trine was awesome, but Trine 2 managed to significantly improve what was already a fantastic game.  The major improvements over the original in order of significance: (1) online co-op. Need I say more? (2) the ability to save mid-level (cannot stress enough how much I appreciate); (3) combat - while the mechanics are the same, enemies are much more challenging, compelling and aesthetically interesting. I enjoyed combat in the original, but repeatedly killing skeleton soldiers wasn&apos;t all that gratifying; (4) puzzles - after only a few levels I noted that the puzzles seemed slightly more challenging than those in the original. Perhaps this is a trade-off for the ability to save mid-level. Whatever the case, I found the overall difficulty to be about perfect. I also loved the new environmental additions, such as water that makes plants grow, etc. Great stuff.; (5) graphics/art design - the original Trine was a gorgeous game and yet the sequel is noticeably more visually stunning. Probably the single prettiest game I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>
<br>I cannot recommend this game enough, particularly at the very low prices at which it can typically be had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3989848">Expand</a></span>

The visuals are stunningly beautiful, vivid, and breathtaking, every animation looks great, the controls are totally spot-on. Coop and great dlc round out the experience. You can play Trine games in many different styles and they are all fun. Blow by everything as fast as possible, swinging along, kill everything with the warrior, or plod along carefully with the wizard, picking up every bubble collectable in and out of sight. Of course, most of the time you are doing a mix of the 3.
<br>Hard to say why this isn&apos;t a 10/10, because Trine does everything right and then some. But, maybe something was missing  a very small something, that I can&apos;t put my finger on. Trine 2 is well deserving of anyone&apos;s time (and money).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188119">Expand</a></span>

This is the genre of 2d/2.5d that I sorely missed in the 90&apos;s and early 2000&apos;s. When devs should of been mastering this genre instead of focusing on 3d models due to the incompetent hardware  the time; which was incapable of the feats it can perform now. It is a shame that for a decade we could of really enjoyed gaming with breathtaking software like this. Trine and others like it show to us how a 2d/2.5d game can shine. While I applaud and welcome games like trine it seems so late and out of place that it is hard to validate it as a worthy purchase other than for a few dollars. This too is a shame....time takes it toll on all things and I feel sadly that while I will play trine and enjoy it, I will not truthfully enjoy it as much as I once would of.
<br>
<br>Overall a great job, but a lil too late for our current gaming diet and staple. I give it an 8 out of 10 due to it&apos;s outdated style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3836655">Expand</a></span>

Especially when everyone in your team has different abilities and everyone is needed for different parts. The only reason it isn&apos;t a 10 is because the story is pretty cheesy, I usually skipped past all of that stuff because it got to be long periods of not playing.</span>

<br>Great Indie Game where you can play 4 spezific and diffrent classes, mage(spells), warrior (with his shield) and the thief with her arrows and stealth.
<br>So each class has their skills, you can invest the skill points to unlock them.
<br>Some riddles need spezific skills, but most of the time you have more then 1 way to reach the goal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4295199">Expand</a></span>

I think most platformers are boring and uninteresting. Not Trine 2, lemme tell ya! The level of depth and beauty this game possesses will drop your jaw! It is positively the best platform game I have ever played! The ability to switch characters to get past certain parts is awesome for the puzzling. Each characters abilities must be used and, the puzzles are fun! This game is a work of art, truly. I tried it on Steam&apos;s free weekend and I uninstalled every other game I tried but Trine 2. Quite addicting and just beautiful! Don&apos;t be surprised if you find yourself stopping mid game and going &quot;oooo&quot; and &quot;ahhh&apos; cause it&apos;s just gorgeous. Plus, like I said, it&apos;s fun! There is some decent comic relief in the game&apos;s dialogue too. Just a fun, great platformer and that&apos;s coming from a person who hates them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609251">Expand</a></span>

Each have different useful abilities, such as the Wizard being able to conjure blocks, or the Thief being able to grapple onto wooden platforms. You&apos;ll run from left to right, switching between characters instantly if in Single Player, or in the case of Multiplayer, having up to 3 people in the same game.
<br>
<br>The first thing that will strike you, however, is the absolutely stunning visuals. Never have I seen such incredible depth in a side-scrolling platformer. The main game, which slowly progresses through dark forests, to dawn-struck beaches, is certainly something to catch your eye. If you&apos;re lucky enough to have the Complete Story, you&apos;ll traverse through even more dynamic environments such as bleak deserts, eastern-inspired cloud temples, and even through the innards of a large beast!
<br>
<br>Trine 2 isn&apos;t just a pretty face (thankfully), as it does have some challenging puzzles to solve along the way. You can set how long you want before one of the characters voices a hint, but for most of the time, you&apos;ll be able to nut it out. There are generally multiple ways to go through a section, depending on what character you use at the time. Although this doesn&apos;t lead to replayability, it does make for some great emergent gameplay.
<br>
<br>All in all, a good (and usually cheap!) game to have under your belt as completed, especially for those who love to take a screenshot along the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909059">Expand</a></span>

Stepping up and changing several things to make the game somewhat different than it&apos;s predecessor.
<br>Let&apos;s begin with the graphics, for a start. The back drops for each level provide each stage with variety. From lush green woodlands to a witches&apos; home scattered with books, potions etc. Each stage is different and unique. Providing different puzzles and secrets to find.
<br>The puzzles are very similar to the first game. Using Amadeus the wizard to move blocks and Zoya to climb up to otherwise unreachable areas, and of course Pontius just killing stuff for the most part. The puzzles do sometimes have a certain level of challenge but for the most part can be solved by knocking heads with your friend(s) and working it out. As I mentioned in the previous review of Trine, this is undoubtedly a series that is best played friends, for the full experience. But if you do happen to be somewhat of a Billy no mates then you can play alone, which does however make the puzzle solving seem a little more difficult.
<br>The characters, as previously mentioned are the same as the first game;
<br>Zoya the Thief, Amadeus the Wizard and Pontius the knight all with their signature qualities. The level up system still exists as well allowing you to gain various useful abilities to help you solve particular puzzles or just kill enemies quicker. The characters themselves also seem fairly three dimensional, in terms of personality, compared to the first game. Pontius is a kind hearted yet fairly clueless knight. Zoya is a strong willed thief and Amadeus is a fairly cowardly wizard, who at times comes across as a bit of a perv too.
<br>Trine 2 is definitely worth a look if you&apos;ve played the previous iteration of the series or enjoy the challenge of platforming and puzzling. A wonderfully looking game and definitely worth a look.
