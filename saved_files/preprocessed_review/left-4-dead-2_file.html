Look I have almost a nickel. Anyhow I feel like I should comment more on the complainers about Valve trying to make money than the actual game. People are actually mad that a company is trying to make money? Do we all want to live in Soviet Russia or what? Guess what a lot of companies do that, they don&apos;t stop making cars in 2008 just because they made a lot of money in one year. The 2009, 2010 etc. models will come out and people will be happy because its always exciting to get a new product. I&apos;m not going to go into all the good about this game because its all been said before but I will make a couple of comments on needs improvement. I wish Valve would be more creative on the type of games involved. I enjoy scavenge mode but really think there could be more modes. LIke an escort mission (something like TF2&apos;s payload). Also I hate the infected rotation, its overally predicitable. You can never have the joy of having mulitple hunters in l4d2 but instead you get a crappy jockey who is more annoying than dangerous. Oh well overall great game and I do hope they make a third one you communists nerds who hate captilism!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743263">Expand</a></span>

Anyway ... This game lacks the feeling for the original , while the extra content , new maps and everything are good , it wasn&apos;t worth the price of a full title. Valve promised almost everything in L4D2 that they will add it to L4D1 , but no , they made a new game to make money ... The new characters feel lifeless and you don&apos;t want to play them except for Ellis , Nick and maybe even coach. The special infected addons are nice , but they couldev have added them to the first! Spitter and Jockey wouldev suited the first game very nicely , but the Charger ... This is a noobs toy. Would you start for example .. Hard rain? Pick up your stuff before the Diner , all of a sudden charged into instant death. Instant death spot at the beginning of the campaign... FAIL. Same goes to Dead Center and The Parish. Don&apos;t start saying these can be avoided , ofcourse they can be , but if this was your VERY FIRST impression , what would you think? Charger = Waste and for noobs. Anyway to sum this all up , if i play Left 4 Dead , i enjoy it , since its way harder to kill survivors with only 2 hunters , 1 smoker and a boomer or 3 hunters and a smoker or 4 hunters , instead of the lame ammount of Instant death or near death spots in the 2nd game. Playing Left 4 Dead 2 frustrates me unlike no tomorrow .. until i finally decided to Uninstall that piece of crap. Only reason this is getting 7 points , is the new content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745656">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very simple my 12 year old sister has beaten the Campaign numerous times on Advanced and Expert. I personally have not experienced any major bugs... or any minor bugs. Of course there are some map glitches, Like DC-1 you can jump the second floor of the hotel, and thus cheat the infected from being able to reach you. But... that&apos;s minor. And I&apos;m sure in Competitive (cal/cevo) play it&apos;s not allowed. And most casual gamers don&apos;t use the glitch, if they even know about it. Actually it seems like the Competitive teams are the one who use it, go figure. Anyway... this is obviously not an expansion, and in no way, shape, or form should of been a DLC. This should of definitely been a sequel. Rushed? Maybe... High Quality, Action Packed, Suspenseful, Fun, Co-Op Survival? ABSOLUTELY. Hands down, BEST ZOMBIE GAME TOO DATE. The original was already amazing, but this game definitely expanded the gameplay, and added a nice new story to it. Originally I was put off, thinking this might be a buggy piece of DLC trash with some Lipstick on it, But that is definitely not the case. You people crying need to find a girlfriend... Or get a job so you can earn some money to buy this game and stop being so jealous. And that&apos;s another thing... it&apos;s not like Valve is out to get your money, they make a quality game, and market it, If you don&apos;t want to buy it, DON&apos;T. Simple as that, they aren&apos;t holding you up, they&apos;re selling a product that they worked hard on. And... all you people talking about Lazy Coding/Programming... I do it for a living, and all work done on this game is of High Quality. Sure sometimes you take shortcuts, but the new weapons and new uncommon common were done beautifully and in no-way did I feel like i was wielding the same weapon with a different skin, or fighting the same zombie with a different outfit. Bottom Line, Great game, WORTH EVERY PENNY</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743143">Expand</a></span>

I play both. Comparing the two is like comparing TF2 to Counterstrike. Yes, they are both zombie survival shooters, but trust me in saying that they are different games with different playstyles. You have no business rating another game lower based on the fact that your game of choice has a different playstyle. I would buy KILLING FLOOR 2 if I wanted to play KILLING FLOOR 2! For all those who claim that there is &quot;less story&quot; in L4D2, what are they smoking. There is definitely more personality within the characters, and the campaigns actually coherently form a solid story. Great graphics, fun gameplay, and the fact that I can run it at 50 FPS on a four year old mid-range computer make this a classic for me. Killing Floor players, hope you have fun in your &quot;infinately varied&quot; same map cycle only one game type game. I will be joining you once I get tired of L4D2... oh wait, Bad company 2 will be out by then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743099">Expand</a></span>

Why I gave this game a 7 is easy, this game is a massive improvement on L4D1, but Valve&apos;s pricing scheme on this game 49.99 is wayy too expensive for a game whose gameplay is fundamentally the same as a game they made in the past. I am actually saddened that Valve turned to such questionable practices in pricing the game. However, onto the game itself. The graphics update is great, the ability to blow off limbs, heads, cut zombies in two, burn their flesh off is a great improvement for those who wanted to see more realism. The melee weapons are Overpowered however. No human can so cleanly slice through zombies in the way these weapons do. ANd by cleanly I mean ho0w a baseball bat shatters a skull and explodes a head in one hit, or ow the machete goes through the torso so well. This also negates the use of shotguns if you dont mind taking a little extra damage. ANd the actual laugh out loud part of this is that a pistol/shotgun combo IMO is more effective then a Melee/Main weapon simply because as long as you co-ordinate and protect your teammates, most zombies can be brought down with gunfire before the need of a melee weapon. Also there are too many automatics stewn accross maps. This makes the infected side in Versus 100% harder then in L4D1, where Ammo had to be conserved. I think in the week ive played this Ive seen someone run out of ammo on a main gun...once..... withoiut finding a replacement, this game balance is absolutely appauling. The levels they designed could ave been easily made in L4D1 and I am starting to believe that the simple reason for not advancing L4D1 was a need for more revenue. However, do I reccomend this game? Yes, despite the fact its probablyoverpriced, I would have paid about 19.99 had I not been pressured into buying it by my friends. As much as this game is probbaly not worth what you would pay for it now, the quality of the levels are much better then in L4D1, the infected in Versus do much better and the Director has marginally improved. As well, I find the L4D2 Normal mode gameplay (and what you play in Versus) to be much more balanced and fluid then in L4D1, which was quite frankly restrictive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743221">Expand</a></span>

Its worth a buy, it&apos;s a riot. Would buy this over MW2 on the basis on multiplayer. To point out something stupid said on a previous comment by &quot;Onslaught&quot; he is crying about not have a radar? dude seriously, It&apos;s a zombie apocalypse.. do you just find radars lying around the streets which will locate zombies? Didn&apos;t think so.. and also he cries about friendly fire scaling up as the difficulty increases, then later on says that friendly fire is one of the games good points? WTF I wish parents would stop letting their 12 yr old kids use make use of interwebs... its annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745345">Expand</a></span>

As this is a sequel I&apos;ll just discuss the things that separate this from the original. I agree with those that are annoyed at the price of the game, it doesn&apos;t seem to detract too far from the original in terms of graphics and &apos;the feel&apos; of it. However I never bought the original so it doesnt annoy me a lot. :P Also 2 those that are disappointed that it is not like the original, i consider it better for this reason. The Reason: The &apos;Versus&apos; (&apos;VS&apos;) gametype has been amped up considerably. The introduction of new SI presents more threats to the survivors, that make no place on the map safe. Eg; The introduction of the spitter eliminates corner camping and the charger also makes alleyways EXTREMELY dangerous for combined Special Infected (&apos;SI&apos;) attacks. A constantly wary and skilful team is needed to meet these challenges. It seems to me that VALVE really listened to the competitive VS community from the original, and I commend them for that. Digressing a little, I think the &apos;VS&apos; experience could have been made much more challenging for the survivors, by putting down less medpacks, and to the side of the beaten path, forcing them to divert from the &apos;railway tracks&apos; from point A to point B. Plus there needs to be a reduction in the amount of ammo in the weapons. The game does not award accuracy, as ammo and weapon stockpiles are everywhere, and sheer &apos;spraying&apos; from automatic weapons is not punished. It is harder to use the infected but this is only a matter of concern for mostly competitive and serious players. If there is any reason to be longing for the old game it would be minor things such as the greater chemistry and personalities of the survivors, certain weapons and &apos;simpler&apos; VS experience. Personally I love being able to casually get online with a bunch of friends, in a game that promotes conversation, shoot zombies and watch the visually appealing decapitations/blood-squirts. On a final note if you enjoy the artistry of competitive play l4d2 will not disappoint (but you have to be a team player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747378">Expand</a></span>

This one taught me how to stay with my party, unless I really want to get pounced or ridden to death. The three new Special Infected are pretty good, the only problem I have though is that when a Jockey catches a PLAYER, the bots have trouble getting it off. The Charger also tells me either rush narrow hallways or stay on one side or the other. The Spitter quickly gets me moving when she spits, luckily she&apos;s an easy kill. The &quot;Uncommon&quot; Common Infected are also great. Fireproof, Horde Leading, Vision-Impairing, Immunity to Pipe Bombs and Bulletproof. All unique to their own campaigns, what more can I ask for other than a third game with even more exciting campaigns and zombie types?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747155">Expand</a></span>

I was terribly, terribly mistaken. Left 4 Dead 2 does not just polish what it started in 2008, It bring it back harder, stronger, more brutal and bloodthirsty than ever. There is not a single game on the market that gets people talking, yelling, sweating and gripping there controllers quite like this. Every aspect of the game has just the right balance of tactics, run and gun, and all around bad-assery that can only be found in a game made by Valve. The new weapons, infected, uncommons, grenades, maps, locations, crescendos, and finales all flow seamlessly into the thriving and very much alive world of Left 4 Dead. The entire experience feels like a movie. So my advice? Saddle up, get yourself a copy, and prepare to white knuckle your way through the ride of your lifetime.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=739823">Expand</a></span>

Main things i enjoy about the new game is that the versus gameplay is much more dynamic as opposed to &quot;zombies are coming, everyone take autoshotguns and sit in a corner til they&apos;re gone&quot;. Same goes for infected, the variety of infected can produce interesting results with syncronised attacks with the new and old specials alike; eg. hunter+ spitter = hunter rape with added acid damage. or charger+ jockey = charger takes one half way across the street while jockey hops on one and takes him for a ride in the other direction causing the remaining 2 to either split up or go for the nearest survivor either way making infected much more effective and causing havoc. 9/10 mainly because i miss the old survivors :( Would be nice if they did a DLC involving the old survivors but hey i&apos;d be asking for too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=740487">Expand</a></span>

The campgains feel new and fresh and stands out. The new melee weapons add much more tatics to the game such as the chain saw - it gives a advantage to the players for a short while, however you have to make the sacrifice of running out of gas and having no secondary weapon. The community made this game a sucsess and this game was worth every penny and more. The new game adds much new balance with expert and realsim being the next part of that. Unlike L4D&apos;s expert - L4D2&apos;s really takes some skill with the new SI on the side. Realisim adds a whole new part to the game. It takes part most the in the campgain &quot; Hard Rain &quot; as you can get lost easily, taking part in the sugar mill level most. This time valve made the story more clear - this takes part most in dead center - for example if you use the &quot; look &quot; command on a player the character calls them by things such as &quot; miss &quot; to rochelee and &quot; Mr gambling man &quot; to nick. Untill the elevator scene where they all learn each others names - and then start to call each other by their real names. Over all this deserves much more credit then it gets, and this game was only made in a year. Great game - a must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=740548">Expand</a></span>

The first one seemed a bit more polished and to be honest I miss the grainy darkness of it compared to the daytime in New Orleans on this one. A few things I dislike: Grenade launchers. I also feel like they messed up Versus. Hunters don&apos;t seem to work properly. Way too many health kits spawn. Defib units should be left out of the versus games (they were obviously added for realism mode anyways). Melee weapons seem overpowered at times as there doesn&apos;t deem to be any difference between them. They messed up tanks turning them rather weak, i have a hard time with a tank dying to being whapped with a frying pan. The specials spawn too often making it feel more like a mutant instead of a zombie game. Don&apos;t get me wrong though, the game is good. I do like the addition of melee weapons though it feels like they need to be adjusted some. I love scavenger, which i find to be more fun than regular versus. The new weapons are fun and I like the fact that there&apos;s some variety in the new finales instead of just zombie wave, tank, zombie wave, run. Still, the game could use some work. Maybe they&apos;ll get it right next November in L4D3.

This is what a true fps is suppose to be like. Its all about teamwork and fast reaction time. If you gave it a 1-7 its because you suck at this game no question about it. Go play a game that is easy like COD.</span>

While the first one finally made zombie games actually scary (the zombies look even scarier now), was a good first-person shooter, and the best co-op game of the whole year, the second one takes all of those from before and greatly expands upon it. It adds a much larger slew of weapons and equipment, which serves to mix things up a bit and makes things more fresh, particularly with the addition of melee weapons. It makes all new Campaigns that have MUCH more originality and difference that in the first game, makes Crescendos actually interesting (it frequently isn&apos;t just &quot;hold out for 2 minutes&quot; anymore)... The finales are all pretty interesting, too. In Dead Center, you have to fuel up a car with gas cans that are scattered all around the area on different floors to escape. In The Parish, you actually have to run across a bridge and get to the end to survive. All of these things serve the purpose of making Left 4 Dead less repetitive, and it sure as heck does. Additionally, there is the introduction of three new Special Infected, which all serve their different purposes; with the Spitter, it&apos;s putting the nail in the coffin on the all-too-common and all-too-effective strategy of &quot;stacking&quot; that was abused in L4D1. WIth the Charger, it&apos;s scattering a group of players and leaving them all vulnerable while also running off with one Survivor. With the Jockey, you are given complete control over where a Survivor goes, and thus you can scatter them from their group very effectively, even to the point of making them hang onto a ledge. Versus is even more fresh at this point, and suddenly, being a Hunter isn&apos;t super common and boring. Scavenge is a great new addition to the online multiplayer, which, while making your time as one team (Survivor or Infected) less annoying, also serves to make the game a whole heck of a lot less frustrating playing online. With Versus it&apos;s pretty serious business, with Scavenge it&apos;s just a short, nice game. Realism Mode really isn&apos;t a new mode at all, more just a new setting. It can be applied to any difficulty, and it makes Witches always instantly kill, makes bodyshots far less effective to the point of you wondering how this is &quot;realism&quot;, and worst of all, removes all player glows, even when someone is puked on/pounced. It serves to make teamwork extremely vital and it makes you go for headshots as if it&apos;s Counter-Strike or something. While I do not particularly enjoy this mode, and I doubt many people do, it does bring up a new challenge to do, especially with the &quot;The Real Deal&quot; achievement. Speaking of achievements, the achievements in Left 4 Dead 2 are fantastic. Just like the original, they are extremely varied, most of them being fun, and you never have to go too far out of your way to get them. It also only has one repeat achievement from the first game, that being to beat all Campaigns on Expert, as it would be absurd not to include that. The achievements are weighted in such a way that they are mostly for Campaign play, but almost all of those can also be earned in Versus as well if you feel you are up to it. There are a few achievements for the new Scavenge mode that are fun to strive for, and while you can earn any Infected achievement in either Scavenge or Versus, there are some that are easier to earn in Versus and some that are easier to earn in Scavenge. There is a measly one achievement in Survival, which, while some might consider it a shame, I personally do not as it was not a very popular game type in the first place and is very unsatisfying in general. Thankfully, there is only one achievement for Realism, but good luck getting it, as it requires you to survive a Campaign on Expert with Realism mode enabled. Truly an achievement that takes much effort, showing that there is a good blend of achievements; from easy to insanely hard. In terms of the characters, Ellis has a ton of lines that most all quite humorous and entertaining. Nick&apos;s lines makes him the only believable character yet in the series. Coach is supposed to be some kind of leader and encourager but he frequently ends up coming off as just annoying. Rochelle is just a complainer who makes really lame jokes and she screams really, really annoyingly when she&apos;s incapacitated. So overall, I liked the Survivors better in the first, but Ellis is, without a doubt, a hilarious edition to the series, bringing up much of the comic relief in Left 4 Dead 2. Back on to Infected, it is even more fun now to play Infected, as it is more varied as to what you will be, and you can make a much bigger influence than before. In the first game, if a team was extremely good at sticking together, the worst thing you could send them was a Boomer, and even that proved quite ineffective frequently. Now, you can deal with Stackers and people who are good at grouping with the Spitter or Charger, which are both very much welcome additions to the game, as well as a blast to play, although the Charger can be extremely difficult to play. Another small edition to the game was &quot;Uncommon Infected&quot;, which are basically Common Infected that have around 1/10 or so of a chance of spawning in the place of a Common Infected. They possess special abilities that are not terribly game-breaking, but once again, serve to make the game more fresh. There are Infected CEDA Agents/Hazmat Infected, which are fire-resistant and occasionally drop Bile Bombs, Clowns, which alert other Common Infected with their squeaky shoes, effectively creating miniature hordes, Mudmen, extremely dexterous, fast, and sneaky Infected that slightly obscure your screen with mud upon each hit, Worker Infected, which are tougher than Common Infected and are not attracted to Pipe Bombs, and Riot Cops, which are wearing bullet-proof kevlar, meaning that you have to shoot them in the back to actually kill them (yes, even headshots don&apos;t work, which is ridiculous). As far as bad things go, there are not, in my opinion, many problems with Left 4 Dead 2. There are, of course, many minor glitches that can really make you mad at the game, as L4D2 was clearly rushed. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s rushed, but it still seems to be a very complete game. Another thing that is extremely annoying is that the Tank is probably only half as scary as it used to be; they&apos;re really slow, and on Expert, the only thing scary about them is their concrete throw, which still proves to be quite annoying. In Versus, it is extremely easy to backpedal a Tank even at yellow health without it catching up, and you can circle-strafe to a lot of effectiveness even at red health. While playing the Boomer, it is obvious that you can now not vomit through, for instance, Common Infected; which is just plain annoying and a pointless nerf. Also, something that is not really a negative but just something I will say; Valve really should work on their first-person animations. I&apos;m sorry but when you&apos;re flying through the air after being punched by a Tank and your hands just plain disappear, that&apos;s just lazy and I think that showing a lot of different first-person animations serves to make the flow and integration of the game much better. AKA, Valve, please take lessons from Dice because they made Mirror&apos;s Edge and that game was absolutely fantastic at that. While I said before that the zombies look more scary now, the Tank is completely the opposite if you ask me. Sure they&apos;re not a whole heck of a lot different, but now they have... shiny abs? What the crap? So yes, the Tank is now less scary gameplay wise and appearance wise, which is kind of sad because they really used to just be plain scary. Another annoying thing that is similar is Witches. The Witches are just plain slow at responding now and you can kill them really easily due to them having a reaction time that was increased by probably a full second. This may not sound like much, but when it comes to first-person shooters, it is. Especially disappointing is the &quot;Wandering Witches&quot;, which are supposed to be more easily disturbed but instead are actually even easier to avoid and react even slower despite the fact that they stand up. But besides a few little things, Left 4 Dead 2 overall is a fantastic game that is perfect for co-op with your friends off or online, playing against/with random people, and shooting zombies. Buy it, it&apos;s seriously amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747010">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Before playing Versus mode, however, make sure you have played through Campaign mode completely at least once.</span>

Valve has put a lot of effort into balancing the game and improving its graphics, and it makes for an enjoyable multiplayer experience with friends. However, the game has quite a few fundamental flaws. The versus games often end very early due to a whole team ragequitting. This makes it very difficult to actually play an enjoyable game. The single player mode is unplayable, there is no way to work with a team of bots. The ability to restart a chapter or return to a lobby is often abused by teams when they first lose. A game can be lost because a single player will not cooperate, and either rushes or uses his own strategy.There are many greifers. Though many of these issues are beyond valve&apos;s control, they severely detract from the experience of the game. I do not recommend you buy this game unless you have at least one or two friends who will play it with you to avoid these issues with the multiplayer game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1614533">Expand</a></span>

The promised revamped AI director wasn&apos;t as amazing. The voice acting(especially rochelle) hasn&apos;t been as good. The new alarm events, new infected, and new gamemode (including mutation) are pretty creative and fun though. Although campaign can get too easy and boring over time, i feel the strength of this game lies in its multiplayer. It is immensely fun to play with friends, whether you are dominating in pubs or are playing against challenging opponents. There are learning curves and strategies to play both the infected and survivor, and valve designed it so it is easy to pick up for beginners, while maintaining a high skill ceiling for advance players to hone their tricks. Once again Valve never disappoints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1492134">Expand</a></span>

I can understand where people are coming from in being die hard L4D1 fans previously. However, i started with L4D2 first over a year ago, and it is the BEST online game i have played to date. I bought L4D2 about 6 months ago and while it still have that awesome L4D gameplay, it was just nowhere near as polished as 2 for me. I like in 2 how there is comedy and interesting levels, where 1 seems to have focused more on the horror effect, where there is a dark and gloomy atmosphere. To be honest, i don&apos;t see how the atmosphere really makes the game better or worse.
<br>
<br>Left 4 Dead 2 has a huge replay value. You can go on and on and constantly learn new things. I personally play all game types, but usually prefer versus. This is one of those games where it will constantly evolve into a better game. The online community is still very strong (even in 1). It is definitely hard to start off when you don&apos;t know maps etc. My suggestion is to read/watch some strategy guides or videos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1581150">Expand</a></span>

The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I&apos;ve seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely a masterpiece!</span>

It&apos;s not Left 4 Dead 1.5, but Left 4 Dead 2.0 as the title suggests. There&apos;s twice as many guns, melee weapons can be used as secondary, new equipment and grenades, new enemies, more campaigns which last longer, new characters who join originals and new maps as well as new game modes. There&apos;s Realism, scavenge and more maps for survival. It&apos;s a new game alright- a great continuation from Left 4 Dead. So why do I only give it 7/10? Simply put, the game&apos;s appeal doesn&apos;t last too long. No matter how much you add to it, killing zombies gets boring very quickly. The achievements, as usual with Valve games, are creative but pointless. Zombies in CoD are way more addicting even without achievements. If you liked Left 4 Dead, this is definitely worth gettiing. But despite the AI director in both games, it&apos;s just not addicting. I suppose in CoD Zombies it&apos;s addicting to beat your best. Here, in survival mode, it just doesn&apos;t grip me at all. Maybe it&apos;s the gameplay mechanics, maybe it&apos;s that in CoD you get 2 types of zombie. Issues still exist with the AI though. They&apos;ll try to heal you when you don&apos;t need it, for example, in the middle of a horde. Their only use is as a storage for all the pills and healthpacks you didn&apos;t pick up. Generally, Valve&apos;s shooter doesn&apos;t feel like a 2009/10 release due to the Counter-strike gameplay. With their games, it&apos;s much more about the concept rather than the intricate details. Overall, the game is a complete package, since you get survival, co-op, single-player, and competitive multiplayer where you play as the zombies as well. It&apos;s a good game, but still not one I&apos;d want to play for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1823428">Expand</a></span>

Like most games these days the game shines more in the multiplayer aspect and the numerous mods and addons that one can acquire through various means. These addons and multiplayer flavors are where the fun is. The single player is tolerable and is fun to play when bored but the AI really is sub par (the other survivors have god-like accuracy but are dumb as a rock in relation to self preservation, i feel as if i am babysitting them in most situations). But if you are playing L4D:2 you need to be playing it with other people as the additional survivors or as the special infected. In summation the game as a whole is worth playing and is highly replayable, but if you are more of a loner and play singleplayer exclusively then you may want to overlook this title and perhaps pick up another zombie shooter that caters to the storyline and solo play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2015427">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Negatives: Pretty typical plot and equally typical enemies. You have the big slow but strong enemy with lots of health, the kamikaze enemy who explodes if you let him get too close, and the normal zombies don&apos;t do much other than run into your bullets or melee. Then you have three basically identical enemies who incapacitate you and then  you need someone else to help you out.
<br>
<br>The positive: The multiplayer is where the game shines - with good planning you can quickly kill the opposing team and if you are the humans then you need to have quick reflexes and be able to adapt to the situation fast.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there are times when it is wiser to just let your teammates die because they died much further behind everyone else and  going back risks the entire team. I don&apos;t feel that is great team play, but that&apos;s how the game works out sometimes.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, if you enjoy a pvp oriented first person shooter that requires a bit more than just point and shoot you will enjoy this game. If your more of a single player or your looking for an interesting story... keep looking.
<br>
<br>Even in purely pvp standpoint I would recommend quite a few other FPS shooters before this one unless you love zombies or something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2711556">Expand</a></span>

What I mean is, if you have a ton of gamer friends who play at the same times/frequency as you, this game can be GREAT fun, especially with versus matches.  If on the other hand, you do NOT have a ton of friends you can play with, the general community of L4D2 is some of the worst I have ever seen.  Because the game content is so limited, multiplayer is very important to the longevity of this game.  Often I have encountered all varieties of douches -  whether they use up all the health packs just to troll, refuse to help their teammates, run off like Rambo into the distance and then die, join your expert level difficulty games in which they gun everyone down before leaving immediately, abuse the microphone and kicking functions, rage quitters left and right, team killers - really, the list is endless.  The randoms community is generally terrible to play a game with, particularly in versus.  In my own personal experience, I have a survival rate of 99% and never get accuracy below 30%, I frequently get accused of hacking because of my ability to spot enemies and dispatch them quickly, often (90%+) top damage in versus, and yet I have often been the scapegoat for &quot;why we are losing&quot;, and subsequently kicked despite being decently skilled as survivors and zombies.   It could just be terrible luck of the draw, but you definitely encounter these kinds of folks if you play this game with randoms.  While you cannot blame the developers for attracting such a freak show, there are plenty of other things you can still blame them with.  If you like single player, you will find that it the game is basically L4D1 in mechanics, graphics and gameplay.  The new weapons are more like an expansion pack than an entire sequel, and while levels are very different experiences, it is so much the same game they easily ported the L4D1 maps over.  Story line is minimal as it was in the previous L4D, and levels are still designed so that in reality, you could easily avoid lots of the terrible situations they put themselves in by simply climbing a fence.  There are a lot of piss-off-the-horde-and-then-dash-through-them scenarios, where if you stop pushing you will most certainly die because of your ammo will run out, and zombies like to run these comically stupid zig-zags which make them more difficult to shoot, but make absolutely no sense.  My overall verdict: if its $5 on steam, it&apos;s a good deal.  If you have lots of friends who will play, it&apos;s great fun.  Overall its neither novel nor spectacular in any sense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2448568">Expand</a></span>

I give out 10 of 10 points because the game does what a game should to do: Fun.<br>I play the whole time VS and sure, sometimes you&apos;ve got problems with flamers and griefers, but sometimes you&apos;ve got also good teams and a lot of fun. One of the best MP-FPS I&apos;ve played.</span>

However, from what I have played of L4D2 I can say it does have a somewhat short campaign, but the DLC that has been released for the game does add new stages to survive through, and nonetheless this game has a charm created by the several zombie types and the randomization of how/when and in what quantities they come at you that lets you have a lot of fun with your friends online every time you play.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not the type of game that you play non-stop for several weeks or months, at least not for me, but it is the type of game that you can always pick up and play when you&apos;re in the mood and you&apos;ll be guaranteed a good hour, or two, or four each sitting. Really fun game and a good addition to the Valve library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2500134">Expand</a></span>

<br>The variety because of  the different maps, the different unknown combinations of Special Infected you&apos;re facing and the alternation between Survivors and Infected, makes the Versus mode irresistible.

The best part is, if you don&apos;t like something about the game, you can probably improve it or at least add to it with the Steam Workshop, including mods that make your CPU allies more useful, and entire new campaigns to run through with friends.  I&apos;d have given this game a lower score if I were to account for the awful, rude, and constantly-griefing PvP community.  It&apos;s League of Legends bad.  If you find decent people to play with, however, or you just like going solo, this is the best zombie shooter ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3453553">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is really easy to learn, just a few button and you can do all basic tasks. Needs more weapons and maps thought, but also has very good range of addons which user can install. Really, only big lack is too few single player modes: need scavenge, versus and survival single player too!</span>

The special infected AI is a lot better in this game, and with the addition of more special infected, make the difficulty of this game higher, which is very nice.  Obviously like the first one, this game should be played online, not alone, as the AI stupidity still seems to be relevant.  What sends this game so far above the first, is the addition of the Steam Workshop.  There are so many addons you can put into the game to have fun and so many maps you can download.  This is easily the best multiplayer game I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3608184">Expand</a></span>

Not much additions have been added, despite some changes on weaponry, characters, special infected and maps. It also manages to feel relatively the same as it&apos;s predecessor, meaning that this game would be fantastic as a DLC. But, if you&apos;re able to avoid thinking about the lack of innovation, you are going to have a blast. But, be sure to bring a friend with you to really achieve the satisfaction of winning a game, because playing alone, while fun, it gets stale.
<br>The variety of guns is rather huge, and melee weapons are added to this sequel too. There&apos;s not much change on guns, but the addition of melee weapons is rewarding. They are fun and satisfying to use.
<br>Special infected appear in this game, with some more types of them. They are satisfying to kill, and they have their unique abilities for attacking the players. Along with the common zombies, all of them are rewarding to kill.
<br>Making strategy is the smartest and the best way to survive. It&apos;s ultimately unforgettable when you make strategy with your friends, and actually winning the level.
<br>This game would score an eight, if not of this negative: the lack of level variation.
<br>Blasting through zombies, while fun at first, it can get monotone doing the same thing every time. Why don&apos;t you add an interesting twist on the level, and not doing the same thing every time  It&apos;s disappointing to see this issue, and I hope they&apos;ll fix this in Left 4 Dead 3. Well, if it&apos;s going to be out in the first place.
<br>Left 4 Dead 2, despite having a lack of innovation and level variation, it&apos;s brutally entertaining for both casual and hardcore players.

But it had drawbacks. The characters were simply boring. The originals were so different yet they connected perfectly. Campaigns didnt have that dark atmosphere that the first game delivered. Sure you got melee weapons which most people swap with the deagle anyway. New infected. And survival was swapped with gathering gas cans. The only plus side is the modding community that sadly swapped from L4D to L4D2 thus creating more campaigns and keeping the game alive. But it was still rushed to make some quick easy bucks...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3774215">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did not want 4 new characters, especially ones as uninteresting as these, I didn&apos;t want to plop down another $40 for a sequel when the first was still relatively new and I didn&apos;t want it set during the daytime.
<br>
<br>However, if you are able to set all that aside and just look at the game play, it IS still pretty fun.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s what&apos;s great:
<br>- Melee weapons!  This should have been in the original and really fill things out.
<br>- Scripted campaigns.  Very foolishly cut from the original game.
<br>- Ability to restart a particular map without restarting the whole campaign.  This alleviates much of the problem of griefers.
<br>- Uncommon infected. A nice touch that makes each map feel more unique.
<br>- Mutations. Great way to mix things up
<br>- Player mods.  Some of the player-made maps are even better than the ones in the game.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s what sucks
<br>-  High-tech military weapons.  This greatly detracts from the mood that these are just 4 random people fighting with whatever was lying around at the time.
<br>- Jockeys!  Are you friggin kidding me? Stupid looking model, stupid special power, stupidly hard to kill.
<br>- AI.  WOW did the AI get dumber!  In the first game the bots would at least respond when you got attacked, now they just stand there looking at you half the time.
<br>
<br>So is it worth buying?  Well from at 2013 perspective after all the player mods and other stuff that has been added I would say YES, although the way this was handled is definitely a black mark on Valve.
<br>I also hate, hate, hate the jockys!  They are silly, their special ability is even sillier and they are silly-hard to kill.  It felt like these things were crammed-in just to expand the inventory when </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684363">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3796372">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an exciting game, that isn&apos;t hard at all to pick up on, especially with other people. Careful with friendly fire though, I got yelled at a lot for that. The only downside was that I haven&apos;t really played it in a while, it&apos;s not something I&apos;m always in the mood for.</span>

L4D2 (as L4D did) combines simplicity, teamwork, and of course - the sheer pleasure of killing hundreds of rabid people. To answer some things people have complained about: Why isn&apos;t there a radar? Why can&apos;t they just highlight my teammates? Well, first of all - the game (as I see it) was made to be realistic. Do normal people carry a radar (or for that matter have access to one?) and also - it&apos;s not hard to discern your teammates from zombies, they do highlight them when you mouse over them as friendly AND as I have mentioned before - the game is supposed to be realistic, giving a radar or always highlighting your teammates just makes the game less ... well - real.. and would definitely dumb the game down if such was done. Then theres, &quot;omg friendly fire is soooo bad.&quot; Well, let&apos;s be real. if you get shot in normal mode it isn&apos;t so bad - but as the difficulty is raised, it only makes sense that you and your teammates would be better players and AVOID shooting each other, with the addition that greater damage = better deterrent for shooting each other. This also promotes better teamwork which is crucial as you go up in difficulty level. If you&apos;re complaining that friendly fire sucks - get better teammates or shoot better maybe? The realism in this game may be too much for most people - the water slowing you down makes sense (have you ever trudged through water and mud before? It&apos;s not a fast paced activity) - though I completely agree to when the water is just up to the ankles, it shouldn&apos;t be a tough walk (If Valve wanted to be more realistic, they&apos;d have people slip, but people would cry and whine about that being lame as usual). To reflect upon the weapon damage though, I totally agree that the guns do less damage than melee - and it&apos;s unrealistic that melee should be that great in comparison to a gun (not everyone has superhuman strength after all) - and I agree that that needs to be adjusted. Other negatives are that even if you do play on expert - the original game is too short and that I suppose the pvp makes up for it... though I&apos;d rather see more story too. All in all, L4D2 is a great game - there are different difficulty settings for a reason. Need a stress reliever? Play on easy and go berserk. Want to play with others without screaming about friendly fire? Play on normal. Got a good team of friends and want a challenge? Then advanced and expert is for you. The difficulty scale actually makes sense in this game - so heed it well. If you&apos;re crying about how other people suck - well then you&apos;re probably unlucky with team match-up (i&apos;ve had a couple of those before, don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s a reason to hate on the game). I mean, yes it&apos;s not that different from the first - but it&apos;s solid, it&apos;s good, it&apos;s definitely a keeper. I&apos;m not a fanboy/girl whatever you want to call it of this game, but I feel like people aren&apos;t taking this game for what it is (like Quentin Tarentino films). It&apos;s NOT COD, it&apos;s NOT Borderlands - it&apos;s a totally different game from those - so give it a try before turning it away based on what other people have said because it&apos;s worth a shot (zing!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746680">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it was released one year after the first one, yes it is the same game mechanics but with different characters/areas. Those however, are what makes it a new game. Many people thought they should have released dlc for the original and been done with it, but if you look at both games, you can tell the first one was more of a dry-run at the franchise, a polished beta, if you will. It tried new ideas while doing them well. L4D2 is released, and you can see what they were trying to do all along. They succeeded in creating a very nice experience for friends to play and it provides a huge amount of options and game modes to go back to. It runs on Source, which speaks for itself in terms of performance. The lack of content is what held this game back. If it knew it was only going to be a game comprised of multiple short campaigns, it should have prepared for the desire of the consumer for more, by adding at least 5 more original campaigns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2558762">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also not clear if you should be rating L4D2 relative to L4D, since that rating wouldn&apos;t matter to someone who doesn&apos;t have either. Rate L4D2 on its own merits, for how it&apos;s meant to be played, and if you do that, the game is practically flawless.</span>

A fraction of the updates in TF2 could have created this game from it&apos;s predecessor L4D.  Regardless, it is rather enjoyable and scary.  There is nothing like the feeling you get when a boomer pops out from a corner and screws up your vision.  Multiplayer is a veteran&apos;s game, so you better know what you&apos;re doing before joining ( a lot of people are very rude to noobs, which is honestly the worst part of this game, so if you can get past that you&apos;re golden).    I bought this on sale for $5, and would have gladly paid $20 for it.  The biggest problem with the multiplayer is that gameplay ends up being one-sided.  There are 2 teams, and players enjoy stacking a lot.  You&apos;ll often find yourself with utter noobs or else with extreme experts, in which case the game becomes anti-competitive.  You can simply quit when this happens and join a fairer game, so I would highly recommend this 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2897109">Expand</a></span>

There are five levels, all of them are pretty good, although 3 of the 5 are really the best in my opinion, Hard Rain and Swamp Fever are a little mediocre. The new zombies, especially the Charger and the Spitter, make it much easier to break up tight groups of survivors and make more difficult for survivors to bunker up in a corner to fight a wave of zombies. Melee weapons are a great addition, and Valve seems to have learned from the mistakes of the first game by making multiplayer more balanced and devoid of any annoying exploits. This game makes it seem like Valve was taken a bit by surprise at the competitive, and large, interest in multiplayer in the first game and has planned for it in this game. Valve Official Servers and other sometime Mod servers have all been fun for me. I have actually played on some really fun custom mod servers (more powerful special infected, new gun skins, special infected ghosts can fly or choose type of special infected). All in all I love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745396">Expand</a></span>

Melee weapons are rather pointless and actually cripple you in most cases. All of the melee weapons seem to just be re-skins which all have the same swinging animation and do the same damage except for the Katana, Chainsaw and Crowbar. The new special infected seem to serve the same purpose as the previous. A Smoker, Jockey and Charger all do the same thing more or less. Really the only addition I see as significant is a Spitter which is good for separating the group all at once.
<br>
<br>The level design is very closed in and straightforward. There really isn&apos;t much exploration other than some of the building being open but they most of the time lead straight back to your outer, linear street.
<br>This game only being released a year after the first, feels rushed, has poor level design, adding nothing significantly new over the previous and just didn&apos;t feel as enjoyable overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2725568">Expand</a></span>

The new band of survivors do not give you the sense that they are in a zombie apocalypse. In fact, they give you the sense that they love it which kills the little fear that L4D provides.

It&apos;s amusing enough for L4D1 fans, until you play long enough to realize any concept of single player is destroyed by even dumber bots, versus is a constant battle against game bugs rather than adversaries, leaving you online campaign mode as relatively fun. I expected far far far more from Valve.</span>

I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s bad, but its just the same thing I played a year ago. I still enjoy it and I&apos;m thankful for Valve making this epic **** but the next L4D&apos;s gotta be more innovative.</span>

Well they realy want our money realy bad for the greater good of the future or has the first game done poorly for profit? Just like most franchises, their predessors in sequals are far to repetative for their own good.</span>

This game isn&apos;t suspenseful in the least, and is more of a &apos;mow down zombies&apos; game than a &apos;survive from zombies&apos; game.

This is what a true fps is suppose to be like. Its all about teamwork and fast reaction time. If you gave it a 1-7 its because you suck at this game no question about it.</span>
