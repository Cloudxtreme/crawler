Also, you choose at the beginning which bloodline (faction) you are part of, which will directly affect your relationships with the characters in-game, offering variation and replayablility, if you don&apos;t mind already knowing the storyline the second time through. Finally, the level design is very well done, giving varied and interesting locations that will keep your interest, no rampant cookie-cutter design here.<br><br>On the down side, it is a dated game, having been released in 2004, so you will probably only get the most out of it if you don&apos;t mind the avatars looking a bit blocky compared to what you might be used to. I&apos;m sure it was &apos;fairly&apos; close to cutting edge graphics in 2004, but if you can look past it, the game will suck you in and you won&apos;t notice.<br><br>It was mentioned that the game doesn&apos;t feel finished by one reviewer, and while I disagree, I can see why that might come up. The game is completely set at night, so far as I can remember, so you won&apos;t get the bustling city feel that daytime would bring, and also it doesn&apos;t have a huge amount of side quests that seem to pack into games these days (to cover up lack of original content), but there is plenty to keep you occupied.. you won&apos;t get bored.<br><br>Also, apparently the game was quite buggy at release. I&apos;d used the official patch when I played it, and didn&apos;t come across any problems. I certainly didn&apos;t come close to checking on forums, as one or two others had, but everyone plays a game differently, and it&apos;s becoming standard practice to check forums rather than think a problem through, or work around it. Regardless, apparently the unofficial patch made by fans is the best, from what I gather.<br><br>Overall I greatly enjoyed the game and thought it to be underrated, definately a pleasant surprise. At no point did I get bored, even though there are many areas, nor did I question whether I&apos;d see it through to the end, unlike quite a few games which get churned out. The storyline was interesting, and I found myself carefully watching the behaviour of all the characters, not quite sure who to trust, as it should be in a vampire underworld. The hotel level was especially spooky, I might add ;) good job on that. I only wish that there was a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460162">Expand</a></span>

When it first came out reviewers more or less panned it because of its bugs which made it unplayable for many.  I personally never experienced any bugs that destroyed my gameplay experience, but no doubt, it had a few glitches that forced me to save frequently to be on the safe side and be a little patient with it, like a wild animal - wondrous but unpredictable.  That said, there are many free user-created patches which solve this problem, easy to install and find.  I found them almost ten years ago, well-before I started using mods.<br><br>But why bother with Bloodlines if there are other newer games with professional support?  Well, there is still no game out there that captures horror cyberpunk in video gaming so well. It matches Deus Ex for crafty grit and conspiracy.  It horrifies while pulling you in.  Several stories play with zombie survival, even subtly introducing a George Romero-style character.  Other stories feel more like the movie Session 9.  Most stories, though, put you in the shoes of a capable investigator who&apos;s in way over his head - think Blade Runner, with less cyborg and more vampire.  You rifle through drawers, question strange personalities, occasionally run for your life, sneak down hallways, fight notorious killers, meet a variety of damsels in distress which put Witcher to shame, and maneuver between gritty Chinatown Tong.  There&apos;s simply enough style to cover 5 games and yet they cohesively run together to present you with &quot;the World of Darkness.&quot;<br><br>Aside from the stories and mood, the music supports the general atmosphere (with all its turns) with songs from artists like Collide, Massive Attack, Chiasm, and Rob Zombie, as well as some more ambient tracks.  Bloodlines immerses, if nothing else.  But what about the gameplay ask modern players?<br><br>It&apos;s well-conceived but nothing spectacular.  It will feel much like Deus Ex yet again, but with the graphics those fans wished for.  True, by today&apos;s standards of fps, Bloodlines doesn&apos;t amaze.  There are relatively few gun choices, relatively simple combat effects, and you don&apos;t get a ton of fancy moves or smooth-as-butter controls.  What it gives up in combat play it makes up for in choices and character build: just like its runner up in rpgs, Deus Ex.  Comparisons here are unavoidable since the controls can seem a little clunky compared to modern games, but the variety of choices balances this.  Few games offer such variety in character building though, except for maybe Fallout 3.  And few games emphasize those skills as well through multiple routes to solve almost any confrontation.  One might sneak past guards, persuade them to allow you to pass, seduce them with a wink, intimidate with the help of some vampire glamour, find a back entrance and pick the lock, go in guns blazing, or even charge in with a katana like Musashi himself.  There really, really, is no game out there that rewards attention to character creation like this.  Between the quest options, the clan choices in character creation, the character build choices, and your influence on factions, possibilities are endless.  It is literally the only rpg or fps I&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2069631">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps the nicest thing was that this is an RPG that is actually something other than sword&amp;sorcery or cyberpunk.  Based firmly in the well-established pen and paper game, which guarantees rich background and tried and tested game mechanics.  Darkness, corruption, huge depth and variety.  Side quests galore.  I actually snuck hours of game time in my office I was so sucked into this game!

Many modern games have done a few things well, but VtMB is still he full-package greatness.  Let me boil it down in 3 points.<br><br>1) Absolutely UNIQUE play style between many bloodlines (races) way beyond simple +1 to melee or +2 to spell damage.  The extent of which is still unmatched in any game to date.  Ex:  One bloodline have you hiding in sewers, making old lady faint from the sight of you.  Another bloodline have you manipulating people&apos;s mind with psychotic hilarity.  It&apos;s a step-up addition to the traditional persuader, gunner, slasher, sneaker, hacker approaches that this game also has.  Except this step-up doesn&apos;t just play different, it FEELS different.<br><br>2) The more outrageous the character, the more difficult it is for the writer to maintain the suspension of disbelief.  This game has some of the wildest characters in video game and I never blinked.  The game is so filled with great nuggets of excellent writing/design that if you keep exploring, you constantly keep getting amused for many playthrough.<br><br>3) FULLY voiced game with some of the most convincing voice-over in video game.  Combine this with the most effective facial and body animation to add body language.   The characters feel so alive and believable.  Compare this to the character animation and voice work of Half Life 2 (original) and Knights of the Old Republic, and you can see what a technical marvel this game was.  Play the dialogue scenes of this game, then switch to &quot;modern&quot; titles like Fallout 3 or Mass Effect 2.   The game was not just ahead of its time, it&apos;s still ahead in our time.  Today&apos;s games like LA Noir experiments and sell it off like a gimmick, VtMB had VO and animation working just fine in a real game long ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=1825977">Expand</a></span>

The game is a little opaque at first, since even veteran RPG enthusiasts will find themselves scratching their heads at at skills and classes they&apos;ve never met before, not to mention becoming accustomed to the bloodpool/feeding system (which is essentially a more complex mana system) and a non-traditional but pleasantly simplified experience system. Nonetheless, RPG enthusiasts who investigate this diamond in the rough are sure to be surprised at how deep and rewarding a game VMB turns out to be. It&apos;s full of unique characters as interesting and fully developed as any you&apos;d find in an RPG from Bethesda or Bioware---if not more so! The game also goes above and beyond the RPG call of duty by rising above mere fetch quests and combat, sending you on a variety of interesting missions. Don&apos;t be surprised to find yourself playing action one minute, mystery the next, and horror the next. (Not just horror in the sense of &quot;look, there are vampires in this game&quot;, but the game has some truly scary situations, ranging from merely creepy to nail-biting.) Finally, even when you&apos;re killing time in between quests, the game will charm you with its originality and atmosphere. When you find yourself sitting at your desk in your safehouse, checking your email on your computer while laughing at the hysterical &quot;frickin&apos; chicken&quot; commercial on the radio for the hundredth time, you realize that this dark world is simply a place you like to be. VERDICT: If you&apos;re thirsty for a rewarding RPG campaign but are getting tired of swimming in an ocean of Star Wars and Tolkien, you should definitely pick this up. It&apos;s worth every penny of it&apos;s $20 price tag, but if you see it on sale, you&apos;d be a fool to pass it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=1711151">Expand</a></span>

You have different factions and two sides, your decisions result in factions having different opinions of you which results in different quests and dialogues throughout the game. How you choose to go about quests will affect what others think of you. There are many memorable characters in this game and it is full of charm. Not only that but it provides amazing atmospheres and realistic locations. You also get certain races with certain traits and it allows for great role-playing unmatched by most other games. This game has tons of re-playability and has an amazing immersion experience. The only real flaw is the combat. This is one of those games where combat is simply unnecessary and might as well be removed but because the other aspects of this game are so great I can overlook this. Without a doubt one of the best RPGs of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2817279">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has good graphics (for the time it was released), good music, awesome ambient (it&apos;s the most important feature in a VTM based game), the characters are different, and you can play the game in different ways, to reach different endings (it has 5). Certainly, the game deserves the overall rating. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540342">Expand</a></span>

I have hoped for a sequel to this game for over ten years and have decided maybe its better to end on the epic note they did.  Great job to the art and dev teams.</span>

Troika was shut down before they could be fixed but thankfully an awesome modding community not only stepped in to fix the game but also to improve it. Get this, get the unofficial mod, get some more content, and let your inner vamp run wild.</span>

Real, demonic and frightening vampyres can be found only in the Lumley&apos;s &quot;Necroscope&quot; series books. Every other &quot;vampire&quot; is a pathetic, laughable  Period.
<br>However, encouraged by positive reviews and the World of Darkness system employed in the VtM:B, I decided to give it a go. And I was awed. Yeah, finally somebody made a game in which vampires are what they should be!
<br>A very interesting plot, wonderful game system, astounding (and well optimized! Remember that the game was made by undermanned Troika  they must have worked on it 24/7 with glucose IVs attached to their veins, respect, guys!) art assets and game system, memorable characters, awesome voice overs and dialogues, a nice and perfectly balanced mixture of grotesque, horror, black humor and gore, very high replay value... I do not give 10 just because some bugs managed to ruin certain aspects and moments.
<br>I play RPG games for the same reason I read books. I want Adventure, Emotions, want to be taken away from the mundane reality and experience something epic. And this wonderful game gave me a real trip to the fascinating World of Darkness, fulfilling all my expectations and hopes. Thank you, Troika!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3626602">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dark, mature, cruel modern day vampire world among us (nothing childish like Twilight). Great replay value, I ve finished the game 6 times, and every playtrough was unique (every time I discovered something Ive overlooked last time). This game deserves a reboot from the original studio which created it. I really dont know why this amazing game wasnt a financiall sucess and the studio closed its doors. And of course this game desrves a movie adaptation too :) A masterpiece, truly. After 10 years, this game is still TOP among RPGs.

<br>
<br>An RPG at heart, built on the original Source engine, it is a game like no other. I have not played a game that pulled me in quite like this since, and I doubt I ever will do again. Its characters, story and the adult way in which it plays out is simply gaming gold. If you try it, I would highly recommend getting hold of the community patch - which fixes 95% of what was wrong with the game at launch.
<br>
<br>Please, developers - give us more games like this.

The character development system is well sorted out. The combact system is based on real time even if you&apos;re accuracy and both damage with melee or fire weapons are determined by your skills. The musics are really good and well chosen for the game dark atmosphere. A game well done produced by Troika Games (that has also produced Arcanum). The mission in the hotel was really creepy and one of the best level in the game!

Those creepers without torso coming jumping at my face really haunt me in my dreams still! I think this is a classic that unfortunately won&apos;t be matched in a long time when it comes to atmosphere and story quality. If you like good stories this is your game. If you hate bugs, download unofficial patches. If you want to get immersed in the best world yet made in the industry, buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491381">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting and dialogue is extremely well done, and the choices in the dialogue are smart and interesting. The level up system is easy to understand, and the classes are all interesting and unique. Beating the game will take a good 35 hours easily, and beating it again is very with another class is still fun.</span>

The combat system could be better. Still unmatched atmosphere and voice acting, interesting main and side quests. A sequel would blow the *** out of every other modern &quot;rpg&quot;, too bad Troika went out of business.</span>

The release version was buggy but with both the official and unofficial patches it&apos;s the best vampire game out there. For just 20$ you get a lot of fun, side quests, good graphics and can replay it with another clan  Malkavians are sure different from the others. 10/10</span>

Real vampires, not some **** shinning on sun **** Every character you encounter is either a psycho or manipulator, trying to drag you into some **** or at best just wants to ask you for a favor. Additionally there&apos;s a strong atmosphere of the end of the world being about to happen.
<br>
<br>The game gives you loads of options when it comes to dialogues. You have 3 skills exclusively related to dialogues (seduction, intimidation and persuasion) and additionally in some conversations you can use some vampire magic (aka disciplines). A lot in the game depends from your stats - some people will react to you differently if you belong to certain clan (one of them seems to have the whole dialogue script replaced with his own), some of your choices might affect stuff that will happen later in the game etc. Huge replayability.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also not a single classic RPG quest: bring me 10 of X. Every quest has some sort of story behind it
<br>
<br>Sometimes you will have to fight. It&apos;s not Planescape: Torment. Near the end of the game you will be forced to fight almost constantly. You are warned about that by one of the major characters, but a lot of people don&apos;t listen and end with no fighting skills. It&apos;s not a good idea. Battles can be seen from first or third perspective, depending on your current weapon. They aren&apos;t bad, but you don&apos;t get any experience for them, so you don&apos;t feel any satisfaction from taking part in them.
<br>
<br>Graphics look slightly worse than in Half-Life 2. It&apos;s the same engine, but in Bloodlines it actually look as if it was about to crash at any second. To be honest, crashes are rather rare, but minor glitches are almost constant.
<br>
<br>Sound is awesome. Both soundtrack and character voices are incredible.
<br>
<br>Despite flaws regarding glitches, it&apos;s one of my favourite games and I&apos;ve played a lot of them. The atmosphere, sound effects, replayability, nice dialogues, multiple ways of dealing with things on your way all make playing this game very nice experience.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t played it yet, it&apos;s high time to do it. I have finished it 3 times, I&apos;m in the middle of 4th and I already know that I will play the game for the 5th time as well, because I&apos;m currious how would people react to nosferatu character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=4760339">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You should be warned that this game is broken and will not function on most modern machines.  There is an Unofficial Patch made by Wesp5 that fixes nearly all issues with the game and also adds new content.
<br>
<br>Based on the board game, and sequel to Redemption, you play as a fledgling Vampire in California.  The story starts as you create your character.  Here you choose your background, bloodline, and gender.  Backgrounds change your stats slightly and your powers as a vampire will differ depending on your bloodline.  Some bloodlines have some side effects, however.
<br>
<br>The best examples are Malkavians and Nosferatu.  Malkavians are insane and schizophrenic.  You&apos;ll talk like a crazy person, hear voices in your head and see things other people don&apos;t see.  Nosferatu are cursed in a different way as they can&apos;t be seen by humans without violating the masquerade.  This does not make it impossible to beat the game as a Nosferatu, because the main quest NPC&apos;s will still be approachable.
<br>
<br>The masquerade is a system in the game where if you get 5 bad marks it&apos;s game over and you&apos;ll be executed by your peers.  You earn bad marks by displaying certain powers in public or are seen feeding.  You can redeem yourself if you have bad marks by protecting the masquerade.  This usually involves killing someone who is speaking  too much or who isn&apos;t playing it safe like all other good little vampires should.
<br>
<br>Graphics are decent and passable.  The game is an older game, so don&apos;t expect mind blowing visuals.  City hubs are fairly small but there&apos;s a lot to find if you set your mind to it.  There are some nice facial animations that you won&apos;t even see in games nowadays which adds to the immersion.  There&apos;s also several mods for the game to add atmosphere and even more depth to the classes.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is basic.  You shoot things, you smash things.  You talk to people, you kill people.  There are extra dialog options if you level your seduction, intimidation, or persuassion skills.  These skills can be vital to completing some quests perfectly.  You can also recieve bonuses from certain NPC&apos;s for having them at the required level at certain points in conversation.
<br>
<br>You gain experience from doing quests and you level up to gain strength, wisdom, guile, skill, and become more attractive.  If you&apos;re sexy enough you get free hookers! Just like IRL! =P
<br>
<br>The beginning of the game will mostly be fetch quests, with a few baddies to either slaughter or let live.  It&apos;s a game where you can put the fate of nearly everyone around you in your hands.  Being good is rewarded with extra perks like your very own slave ghoul girl, or an extra item/money/experience.  There&apos;s also a decent but easy stealth system that&apos;s based on how many points you have in stealth.  If you max out stealth, are in the shadows and crouch you&apos;re pretty much invisible.  There are also assassinations you can do with each weapon while stealthed and behind your victim.  My favorite is the baseball bat.  :)
<br>
<br>Audio is very good as well.  Just make sure you turn Environmental Effects off or there will be a constant echo.  Voice actors are all top notch and AAA grade ones that you&apos;ll know if you&apos;ve heard them before.
<br>
<br>There are some very good mods for this game available as well.  My favorite being the original Unofficial Patch Plus, but there are other that increase the difficulty of the game and add new quests and bloodlines to choose from.  When installing these big mods you need to remember that they aren&apos;t compatible with eachother.  E.G. Final Nights mod will not work with Camarilla Edition nor with either work with the Unofficial Patch.  Both mods have an Older version of the Unofficial patch that come with it, which still fixes a lot of bugs.  There&apos;s also several mods  that are still being produced constantly by fans.  Every now and then you should check up and see what new mods are out to keep you coming back for more.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you are in need of a good RPG that&apos;s open world with a lot of freedom and are tired of Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc.  Then you should definitely check this game out.  Especially if it&apos;s on sale.  Well worth every penny spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619153">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s strong points come from its masterfully crafted setting and dark atmosphere. Each hub has its sinister secrets, and much of the enjoyment of the game comes from unveiling these mysteries. Most of the side quests are well thought out, and the level design is varied and interesting, The Ocean House comes to mind.
<br>
<br>On the flip side, the combat is rather clunky and doesn&apos;t get much better as the game progresses. The enemy AI is severely lacking in my opinion, and overall just isn&apos;t particularly satisfying. Fortunately, most of the game is preoccupied with dialogue scenes and elements of exploration/investigation rather than combat.

There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play.
<br>
<br>Many of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you&apos;ll find it&apos;s the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666178">Expand</a></span>

(got the Engine DLL error,Less than 15MB RAM available) ..
<br>
<br>Back to the game: A huge RPG-game with long playtime,It blends from First to third-person-view..Great graphics (still today) I`ll think a bit like a &quot;blood-drinking Grand Theft Auto3&quot; ,Do a main-quest,or take many side-quests all over the city for different characters from different vampire-clans.
<br>
<br>Excellent storyline,really awesome soundtracks,cool characters,black humour,plenty of different type of weapons,really creepy,fantastic  and also among the most fascinating levels I`ve ever seen &amp; played in a PC-game,Play as silent stealth,or play as a sword-swinging &quot;give-a-damn-Rambo&quot;,you choose..Hack computers,lockpick doors,crawl inside buildings using vent or sewer-systems,manipulate or seduce people for blood and info,buy &amp; sell items you come across,Build up your character`s strength,stamina &amp; personality,This is fun fun fun..
<br>
<br>This game got everything for everybody..One of my 5 best all-timers still today! This game really should have deserved a international blockbuster-title if Activision had time to repair all the bugs on the original-game,before the release back in 2004..But today there`s patches (fixes) out there,And people really should give this game a second try.! :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=1564723">Expand</a></span>

It is incredibly fun to experience the growth and development of your vampire. The only aspect that will bore you and aggravate you will be the bugs, glitches, crashes, and sometimes sub par AI. Even the voice acting is well done. Easily, one of my current top five favorite games of all time on the PC. Even with all the glitches, bugs, and crashes. Do not miss out on this one!

It really does create the feeling of a separate vampire society. It is a bit more linear that I&apos;d prefer and the random bugs also took it down a nothc. Still a solid game well worth the money.</span>

It is an excellent RPG and a horror game, no game has ever created such a feeling of fear and despair. It feels real and the atmosphere can shift in a second. Enviroments are incredible and well designed just like every part of this game. All the characters are interesting and unique and they all have phenominal voice acting. Gameplay is great although sometimes the combat can feel a bit clunky. It has the perfect difficulty - not too easy to cakewalk through but not too hard to feel frustrating. Vampire: Bloodlines does not stun the player with incredible visuals, instead opting to impress with storyline, environments, well thought out game design and aesthetics all nearing perfection. Numerous bugs can be forgiven because Troika didn&apos;t have time to finish it and since there have been many community patches that make the game as excellent as it is today it is not a problem. The A.I is not great and some of the animations feel off and some are just downright bad. There are also some annoying probles with gun sound effects being way too loud. Still, an A + game absolutely and it truly deserves the praise I gave it and all the good things anyone has ever said about it are true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881887">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>gameplay- the controls are solid. its preferred to play in first person since the 3rd person is a bit hard to control when aiming with guns and other things. there are lots of side quests and doing them will let you know more about the happenings in the vampire world. it has some nice dialogue choices and depending on what type of character you choose to play, it reacts to you and vice versa.
<br>
<br>video- the graphics are great, using the source engine. i believe the first game to do so. and you know how the source engine has become popular with lots of new games after. audio- music sets the mood and the effects are great. the voice overs are also well done. overall- the game is one of the diamonds in the rough type games. not many know about it or its really underrated. and not many games revolve around vampires like this  so its special in its own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2949164">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is becoming a cult hit.  The basic elements are a solid goth vampire storyline and Deux Ex action-rpg play style.  The voice acting is excellent and you&apos;ll have a lot of fun just exploring the richly detailed world.  There&apos;s tons of overt and covert humor and references to gaming culture.  If I had one minor criticism it&apos;s that it could use a bit more action.</span>

I am aware of the buggy state of the game at release, but by the time I discovered this great game Wesp had already done a few unofficial patches.

<br>
<br>The strongest element is the amazing atmosphere. The intriguing WoD setting contributes to this, as well as the incredible soundtrack. This game really does side quests well, better than almost all cRPGs and has two of the best levels/quest lines in gaming: the Asylum sisters&apos; quest line in Santa Monica with the creepy/tense Ocean House Hotel and the Malkavian Primogen Mansion. It is a hub based experience, so yes it is linear, but there is so much to do and so many interesting characters to interact to in each city that the game world feels bigger than it is. Each bloodline can offer a unique play style whether it be sweet talking, persuader, stealth, magic, guns or fists. There are different ways to solve most quests, with some solutions being quite interesting. Most characters are very well developed and come off as believable and unique. It has great replayability, not only with the different bloodlines but certain choices and way to approach situations. All fans of RPGs should give this game a try. There&apos;s just no other game that compares; VTMB is truly unique.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3721879">Expand</a></span>

Take note that it is mired by a few bugs which can get annoying. For most RPG fans, this game is pretty nice. For Vampire fans, this is a good game to get the feel of being a vampire and being part of their society. It is truly a wonderful game.</span>

My computer qualifies the highest standarts the game requires. In spite of that the bugs are there. I think it would be better if the story occurs in other places in the world. If other places were mentioned you would be experinced adventure.</span>

I know: I&apos;m a freak) And I found this game to be thoroughly enjoyable. I will admit it was plagued with glitches but the 36 (not counting failed attempts, restarts, crashes and the like) hours I spent were worthwhile. The &quot;Jyhad&quot; as the game calls it was ambitious with so many factions and stories crossing over each other but not unlike LucasArts&apos; KoTOR II (Don&apos;t take it as a diss or a plug) the ending seemed rushed, as if all their ambition was stifled with a strict realease date. Though there are plenty of opportunities to get through situations by talking, more often than not violence is the only solution so abilities are weighted toward combat and stealth making it hard to end the game with less aggressive characters. The cast is lively and colorful and most of the voice acting is very appropriate. You can really get attatched (Oh how I loved VV) to the people who spend their lives and unlives in you. The final scene(s) despite the scenes leading up to it (Which in and of themselves aren&apos;t that bad) is excellent and really the perfect twist. Worth the time getting there. PLay it. A few times actually so you can see all the clans in action since people do respond to your clan throughout (very nice touch) but it&apos;s a far cry from perfect.

Sadly, making interesting games doesn&apos;t pay so developers sink (R.I.P. Troika). If you look at the history of innovative video games you can see more examples of that - Looking Glass Studios, Interplay . . .</span>

At times the animation can just look outright silly, and some of the cloth effects are rediculous to. Story wise, this game delviers a very interesting and compelling story, though there are several frustrating moments throughout the game that suffer from severe balance issues for either being a trivial encounter at higher ends of the game, or jsut over whelming encounters that unless you get set up perfectly for you have very little chance of completing. Over all, even with it&apos;s imperfections and wonky character animation and design at times (and rather oddly small maps compared to teh characters) the game has a very compelling story to play through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=423594">Expand</a></span>

Based on the HL2 Source engine, it&apos;s environs are rich and detailed. Characters are lively and move flawlessly, and the story is awesome. Get HL2, and get this game. Both are shaping up to be great games.</span>

The game is very well done overall. Melee feels &quot;arcade&quot; like, which is a bit of a disappointment. The Disciplines (spells) are all well thought out and have some interesting graphics. I am using firearms and have a moderate skill and finding it works fine - aiming might be linked to performance of your computer? Although guns rarely do even 1/2 the damage melee attacks do. The story is wonderful - not since Deus Ex have I seen this much attention to detail and intelligence in dialogue! Graphics are overall well-done with only Half-Life 2 outpacing it. The emphasis is definitely on the RPG side of this game, NOT the shooter side - so don&apos;t buy this if you want an intense action game. DO buy it if you want an immersive RPG with overall stunning visuals, excellent plot, and deep character development. The combat is average to below average - but, for me, it hasn&apos;t detracted much from the overall game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=377708">Expand</a></span>

It does curtiously provide you with enough time to put on a pot of coffee while it loads, and reloads. I would be more interesting in replaying it if the game seemed to promise more variety the second-time through, but all I&apos;d really be doing is switching vampires. Good time, overall.</span>

Also, &quot;talking characters&quot; have a much, much harder time than &quot;fighter characters&quot; as so much of the game ends up with combat. If more time had been put into clan balance, the last few missions, and overall polish - we would have one of the best games of all time on our hands. But, I guess we&apos;ll just have to settle for one hell of a game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=382289">Expand</a></span>

If you let your humanity slip, you?ll approach the world as an immoral monster. High seduction? You?ll find good looks can get you farther. While some have described the combat as ?clunky? I haven?t found it so at all. It does depend heavily on your stats, so if you don?t put points into combat related attributes and talents, expect to have your butt handed to you on a regular basis. My only complaint is the lack of clothing/character model options. If you could change your look a bit more, it would be a totally immersive game. I?ve had no major graphics glitches, and I?m running an athlon xp 2600, 1 gb of ram, radeon 9600 128mb graphics. Hardcore VtM fans will note some significant departures from the pen and paper system, but I?ve found most of these compromises helped the flow of the game, and contributed to the overall experience. Each clan is represented well, though the character quiz heuristic is horribly broken. But if you know what clan you want to play, that doesn?t really matter. In any case, this is one of the most intense RPG experiences I?ve ever had. Spooky as hell. Very dark, but infused with Troika?s offbeat humor that gives the game some singularly hysterical moments. This is as close as you?ll ever get to feeling what it?s really like to enter the World of Darkness. Here?s hoping they make expansions and sequels ad infinitum. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=377779">Expand</a></span>

If you are a fan of non-linear RPG with beatiful story and rich dialogues, and you enjoyed the games I listed, then you will love Vampire the Bloodlines.</span>

In a pc game atmosphere and story IS everything. The story and dialogue and characters in this game are unbelievable. Best dialogue in a pc game for a long time. Finally a successful marriage between the instant gratificatino and appeal of an FPS and the deep gameplay of an RPG. You will need a relatively up to date pc to run it in all its glory though. But trust me this is like the offspring of a mating between Fallout and Halflife 2 Please Troika let there be a sequel (or add-ons even).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=378417">Expand</a></span>

Once you get past the mediocre 45 minutes of a tutorial, that&apos;s when the game truly begins. It starts off more like a crime/noir style story with vampires, but eventually you get to try out all sorts of missions, ranging from full-on action, to stealth, to horror. The RPG elements are very good, because in the beginning you get to choose to play as one of 7 clans, all possessing different strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities. And as you progress through the game, you can choose to level up any of the available skills, and there are many. The story itself is pretty good too, many of the characters are memorable, and many of the locations are pretty atmospheric (even though some missions are really bland, like the sewers level). I&apos;d say the game gives off some Deus Ex and GTA vibes, except with vampires. Now then, the game has aged quite significantly over the years and you can quickly see that the combat mechanic is nothing special. However, since the game is not all about combat, this is not a big flaw. Overall, if you&apos;ve tried to explore and do all the sidequests, a single playthrough should last you at least 30 hours, and since you can play as up to 7 clans, the game has a good replayability; and although the story is very linear, the game has lots of sidequests, and of course multiple endings. So I&apos;d say it&apos;s one of the better RPGs I have played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2290651">Expand</a></span>

But I can ignore them because of the depth and immersion this game has which really gives you the terror of living in this mythological world, then contrasted to how fun the combat is, which provides a challenge but doesn&apos;t make you want to hit your head on the wall until one of the two breaks. Oftentimes I find myself much more afraid of breaking the masquerade than myself dying, which gives the game a unique fear not like other games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3722633">Expand</a></span>

The characters are interesting, the music is the best and helps maintain the gothic feeling of the game. The quests are most often very well composed and often surprises and frightens you. When creating a character, you choose from the different races of the Vampire rpg-world. I played as a Ventrue, the leader-race of Vampire-society. The great rpg experience and level-up point system as well as the talk-mode reminds me of Fallout, which is not surprising since Troika made the game, and I sincerely hope this tradition will live on, as this appeals to me. You will have to spend the experience-points carefully though, the game has some hard enemies.
<br>
<br>The game has a very dark and creepy feel to it, so it is not for everyone. You won`t survive here unless you`re cold enough to suck blood of a strangers neck.
<br>
<br>Lacuna Coil and Tiamat have some great sound-tracks here, the other sound tracks are also great.
<br>
<br>The graphics are neat, the environment of the night-towns, the clubs etc. is generally interesting and enjoyable, which is important as you will have to do a bit of walking back, forth and around to solve the quests.
<br>
<br>As for the combat system, II found the sneak and kill-method a bit too easy compared to the man to man fighting. I can`t say I totally agree with the critics saying the combat system is very clunky. It works quite well with me.
<br>
<br>Just one thing to say, this game warms my heart..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873679">Expand</a></span>

The dark atmosphere of this game is great. I replayed this recently and I have to say that this game holds up very well despite being nearly a decade old.   Try it with the unofficial patch and enjoy!</span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, that signature Troika ambition also means lots of bugs and some mechanics that just don&#x2019;t mesh well. The endgame includes some particularly sloggy dungeons, but no other game truly drops you into a Vampire world. Where else can you play as a character who is actually insane? This is truly a cult classic of an RPG, and the fan base has been patching and improving the game ever since release. and for that they have our thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=6360525">Expand</a></span>

The haunted house one i had goose bumps and my hair was standing up all down my back (no i dont have a hairy back but you know what i mean) Well done whoever made this game. Halflife 2 gets the thumbs up for makin the engine but in terms of a gameplay this game smokes it completely what a rad game. Only disturbing thing is too much play gives you vampire dreams and you do feel a bit weird when you wake up and you fell like you&apos;ve been suckin on someones neck half the night :o. Anyway back to more about this game. Its storyline is awesome, has real attitude and some great humoour. You can choose from different clans and some of the more powerful ones have their drawbacks for example the royal bloodline of vampires can&apos;t suck bum blood or Priostitue blood.. its jsut no healthy for the and they start to throw up. Id say whatever type of vampire you think you are theres one for you there. Best game i played in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines/user-reviews?user_review_id=378468">Expand</a></span>
