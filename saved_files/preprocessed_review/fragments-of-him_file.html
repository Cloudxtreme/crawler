<br>Good execution with an okay set up
<br>Fragments of him is a 2 and a half hour long interactive narrative based game about Will..
<br>Why is will important?
<br>I have no idea and this is ultimately my biggest issue with this game&#x2026;
<br>This is a very touching story, you play as an observer, as 3 people close to will tell you about their life with him and how he impacted them&#x2026;
<br>His grandma, his ex girlfriend, and his boyfriend&#x2026;
<br>As the observer your job is to essentially set the scene&#x2026;
<br>and as you do so the character a scene is about will narrate telling you stories and their thoughts about will.. really immersing you into the moment&#x2026; making it feel like youre there instead of just watching and listening..
<br>ocassionally stepping in to make a choice on where a certain item goes or what one character says in an important moment&#x2026;
<br>but other than that youre just walking around and bringing life to everything&#x2026;
<br>however you don&#x2019;t get much time with will himself..
<br>the game opens with him..
<br>you find out what happens to him&#x2026;
<br>but you don&#x2019;t get to experience the moments with the characters telling you the stories through him&#x2026;
<br>You don&#x2019;t get to feel what they meant to him, sure you get words.. but no moments..
<br>you only get their perspective..
<br>and because of this I had a really hard time caring about any of it&#x2026;
<br>its like those old people that pull out their wallets at the park wanting to show you their grandchildren and tell you stories about them..
<br>I don&#x2019;t know either of you.. please don&#x2019;t..
<br>I loved how the story was told through you as the observer setting the scene and feel this alone should get fans of story telling in general to play through this game and appreciate the delivery..
<br>this is a story about a gay man and how others perceive him..
<br>though it isn&#x2019;t too down your throat except for the chapter about the grandma&#x2026;
<br>she spoke about herself in a way a hipster at their favorite coffee shop in sanfransisco would talk about old people.. and that entire section of the game felt a little too agenda pushy for me and unnatural..
<br>but the other sections were great and didn&#x2019;t make a big deal out of it..
<br>of course that was the point with the grandma chapter.. but her awareness level of how unfair the way she thought of him was was a little too high
<br>Fragments of Him tells a story in a special way..
<br>you may not care about the journey you just went through by the end&#x2026;
<br>But again if youre a fan of story telling, give it a shot just to experience the great delivery despite the poor set up&#x2026;
<br>I give Fragments of Him
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fragments-of-him/user-reviews?user_review_id=7543449">Expand</a></span>

Fragments of Him takes you through the life and death of the protagonist, Will, and explores the effects it had on those close to him.
<br>
<br>The controls and gameplay mechanics are very simple and take almost no time to figure out. Basically, you need to interact with different parts of each scene and in doing so, the scene and story will advance. The beauty of Fragments of Him isn&apos;t really in the gameplay, or even in the graphics, it&apos;s in the story and narration.
<br>
<br>Throughout the story, you observe the the movements and emotions that come from those that were the closest to Will. Fragments of Him does a wonderful job of pulling you close to these characters. I often felt myself so engrossed in the story that I truly felt like I was a part of the experience and not just and &quot;observer&quot;. Even though I could sometimes predict the outcome of some of the scenarios, it didn&apos;t matter as I loved watching how everything would play out. The character animations/models are relatively simple, but by no means does this detract from the experience.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s kind of hard to elaborate in detail the specifics of the story without giving away key parts that should really be left for you to experience on your own. With that said, if you are a fan of Walking Simulators, well-written narratives, great stories, or if you are just simply looking for a great game that you can loose yourself in for a few hours, Fragments of Him will easily satisfy.
<br>
<br>The Bad
<br>
<br>Short
<br>
<br>The Achievements
<br>
<br>The review was done on the PC (Steam) version of the game and does not have any achievements :(.  Looking at the Xbox Achievement list, they all appear to be story related so they will likely unlock naturally throughout story progression
<br>
<br>Final Verdict
<br>
<br>Fragments of Him does a really good job drawing you into the story and kept me emotionally invested throughout the whole story. I don&apos;t really have anything bad to say about it other than maybe the fact that it is short. The price is fair and the game plays well.. If you&apos;re looking for a great story and soundtrack, Fragments of Him will not disappoint you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fragments-of-him/user-reviews?user_review_id=6480763">Expand</a></span>
