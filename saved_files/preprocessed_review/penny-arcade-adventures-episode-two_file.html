Tedious pixel hunting quests, overly difficult QTE combat, and a boring story with little focus really kills the potential this game had. Although it continues off from the previous game (game mechanic and level-wise), you lose all your old skills for some reason. More frustration comes from a long fetch quest chain that rewards you with a jail cell. Combat is absurd with enemies getting mountains of health plus free &quot;interrupt&quot; heals, removing strategy from combat and requiring you to just pile everything onto one enemy at time. The last boss is a multi-part &quot;gimme&quot; fight, that ends in a lame adventure game last fight that requires no skill and cuts out your party. Overall this was really disappointing, boring and tedious. Just pick up the first one and pretend ep2 doesn&apos;t exist, like a Bioware game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penny-arcade-adventures-episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822797">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t find that much innovation but the game actually improved on some parts and I will be glad to say that the improvements are shown. The combat system, while it&apos;s identical to the previous game, changes the skill activation for the characters and they are far better than the first episode (for instance, Gabe&apos;s special skills are no longer based on bashing the spacebar). We got more areas this time too (6 in total, although 1 is not even explorable and another is just the same room of the previous game for upgrading weapons), and they are also much bigger and more explorable, with the story that also becomes much more interesting the deeper you go. We got also few more secrets as well (you have 3 secret suits you can unlock, with one unlocked by finishing the first episode), and still the same kind of humour and comic-book style art. Unfortunely, there&apos;s nothing else I can really mention: it&apos;s a good game on its own but adds basically few more areas and more story; the rest is totally identical to the original game. Buy it if you liked the first episode and want to continnue...avoid it if you didn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penny-arcade-adventures-episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=2919725">Expand</a></span>

After finishing Episode One - i was really on a roll and wanted to see the continuation of the story (which by itself is a humorous and well-developed in plot).  BUT!  Knowing the fact that the developers left the project on Episode 2 (in the planned Trilogy) in pursuit of money - really made me feel like sheet.  That was the downer of the otherwise very nice idea and game.</span>

This episode follows a similar storyline with as many old school references and a sense for hilarity. The combat has the same mechanics, but the weapons and special attacks have changed completely, which gives it some variety, although I would have liked to have the old skills available. The areas are also different, and the characters you meet I would say are more like-able. The collectibles are easier to find this time, since in the first episode I was barely able to find half of them. It would not give much credit to this game the overall similar feel, however it improves on what it has to and keeps the good qualities the same, the final boss battle is also absolutely insane and belittled the first episode&apos;s boss fight. This game does a great job of bringing us back to New Arcadia and even though it feels a lot like the first episode, it is still enjoyable from beginning to end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penny-arcade-adventures-episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=3061869">Expand</a></span>
