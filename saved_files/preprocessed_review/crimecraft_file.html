Anyone who played orginally will solemnly admit this to you. That being said, the actually gameplay itself has not changed much and is still alot of fun to go back to now and then. This was the first shooter/match game I played that had a social lobby in it and I believe all shooters should follow suit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135163">Expand</a></span>

This game comes close to being good, and actually was fun for me for about a week. I hit level 22 in that week, of a max 50. Because of the pre-order headstart and the fact that I didn&apos;t get in the game for a few days after retail release, I was behind the curve on leveling, even playing frequently. With other players reaching the top levels it has become obvious that the PvP in this game is not skill based as promised, but based on character level and equipment as in most MMOs. Your weapons are already less effective than what a high level character has access to, this is made worse by higher level characters being able to stack damage resists to further widen the gap. This wouldn&apos;t be such an issue if there were level divisions in PvP, but the only divisions are 1-6 and 7-50, so once you reach level 7 you will randomly matched against players of all levels. This is extremely furstrating as you just get killed over and over regardless of how well you play, because you can shoot someone in the back several times and they live to turn around and one-shot you due to the level gap. Levelling up is painful as the PvE is pretty much broken, and only offers two modes. PvP is faster to level up, IF you do well in a match. Unfortunately it&apos;s getting harder to do well in PvP as the average player level increases. In a week or two it will be extremely brutal to newbies, and the player numbers are already very low. Can you believe 300 players online at peak times, for a game that&apos;s been out just about two weeks?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=84381">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not broken or ill-managed or carelessly developed. The graphics are around an 8.8 compared to current games, the animation is top notch, the sound design works very well; all of the game mechanics work really well. So, what&apos;s wrong with it? This game is what would happen if Planetside and World of Warcraft had a &quot;child&quot; and it grew up and became a chartered accountant, taking after both of them, but lacking all of the inspiration and fun that made his parents so likable and a success. I played this game for a few weeks and then moved on out of boredom, it&apos;s just not very fun, there is no variety at all. You can choose to play PvP or PvE but grinding in PvE is monotonous, and you never really get anywhere, the npcs level with you so only the best equipped players are successful in PvE. The skills they offer are boring and under-powered so PvP is decided mostly on who has the bigger gun. Most games consist of two people; people with Heavy Machine Guns who just hold down the fire button the whole time, or snipers who find their favorite spot and camp the whole game away; the game is balanced so those two strategies are the most effective, with grenade launchers in third. All in all there are only maybe 25 different maps, probably less and each of them is about the size of a standard Call of Duty MP map. All other things besides, the auctions, crafting, gangs etc. The core game play just isn&apos;t that fun, it doesn&apos;t have anything that makes me want to come back to it later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=738258">Expand</a></span>

You get two months free when you purchase it at full price. Now, the MMO content is a lot of fun. You can create anything from the clothes you wear to the modifications of the guns that can be created. The PvP is a blast, and I keep coming back for more... and I&apos;ve been playing for over a month. I don&apos;t really feel as if I&apos;m grinding for levels, as I do with other MMOs, but my character is advancing and becoming better. I honestly think this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I have only come along two problems with the game, one of which the developers can do nothing about, and that is a bunch of whiny people playing the game. The only real complaint I have come across is that I think a passive skill shouldn&apos;t have to be equipped, but I guess that&apos;s arguable. Anyway, there&apos;s tons of stuff to be crafted, a persistent Auction House with fluctuating prices, and tons of Third Person Shooter action to be had... All for $50 for two months of free play online and only $10 thereafter.

Yes, it&apos;s a little tough to get into. Yes, the devs put it out there with a downright hubristic money-making scheme. No, it&apos;s not worth paying full-price plus subscription PLUS cash shop money. I think that this game&apos;s major downfall is that they tried to pull too much cash out of a notoriously tightwaddy community; PC gamers don&apos;t like paying for things they could have for free, and in CrimeCraft&apos;s case, the game was not compelling enough to make a real impact on gamers&apos; wallets. It is, however, going free to play. This, I believe, will be a major turning point for CrimeCraft; I hope they pull things up again, as they certainly deserve a shot at getting along now that they&apos;ve realized their most crippling mistake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=85412">Expand</a></span>

There is much to do in &quot;Sunrise City&quot; nd a lot of the people that were playing in the game were older, instead of the typical snot-nosed tweens that love to play 1st/3rd person games, swearing and calling people names. I liked the fact that CrimeCraft seems to have drawn an older crowd. I also think that the graphics in the game are top noihe for a PC game. Granted the specs to run the game are high, the fact that the characters are all dynamically lit and run around the environment so smoothly is really cool. I was happy to pick up CrimeCraft and I&apos;m excited to see what they do with the game over the next two months. If dramatic improvements are made during the two months trial period that comes with the game, I&apos;ll be playing this one for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=84158">Expand</a></span>

Customization is definitely there and extensive, and they&apos;ve even been adding things steadily. At this point I believe that negative reviews come from people that have never played the game. Guys that like action and tough fight should definitely buy it and play it now.

Now with that out of the way, Crime Craft is a very solid game that offers just the right amounts of RPG but doesnt sacrafice the Shooter aspect of the game. Anyone who has ever played DEUS EX will have a soft spot for this game. Being that this game is in its infancy it is expected that the game will have growing pains but this game plays so well and has so much potential for expansion that any complaints are minor in nature. Bottom line is that the success of this game will rest heavily in getting people to play it and then to support this game with alot of Downloadable Content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=84544">Expand</a></span>

The videos, the artwork, the conceptual articles...they all portrayed a game that didn&apos;t come out in the final product. The game that subscribers actually got is somewhat compelling, in small doses. My biggest problem with the game was that the concept wasn&apos;t even nearly done. The world that the players live in is supposed to be somewhat post-apocalyptic. Sure...I guess it is, when there&apos;re no players and a sparse dusting of NPCs in-world. The buildings look too nice, the advertising (which, if it gets the devs money...they deserve their pay too) is too well put together. It&apos;s almost as if it&apos;s a world just...without a digital infrastructure. And that&apos;s it. From the intro video (which is well done, to credit Vogster) players just get...confused. If they want to save the game, it could take a complete overhaul! Give players a game that&apos;s consistent with the art we see and is also in-line with the keywords upon which the game was marketed and we&apos;ll give you a little more time to smooth it out. Right now, it&apos;s just disappointing.

I refunded it not even four hours after purchase. Do not purchase this, there are plenty of games online that are the EXACT same thing and they are free. Who wants to pay $49.99 for a game, THEN pay ANOTHER $19.99 for only TWO MONTHS OF PLAY!! THEN, IT&apos;S $9.99 FOR EACH MONTH!!

They tried to hide my posts in the forums and tried to mute my in game chat. After trying many times and getting many warnings from them to stop. I listened to my heart and couldnt let it keep going on without saying something. It started with 1 post with no slander or wrong information it was full of actual facts and screenshots for proof of wrongdoings. Instead of letting the community voice there opinion they needlessly deleted all posts concerning gm moderation and tried to hide and surpress all evidence. I was not about to stand there an let this go on so i caused a stir as they called it in the community trying to let the people see the truth. Apperently they dont want the truth to be known so i was permimentaly banned from the game and continously needlessly muted. Here is a link to my rant video best explaining what has transpired in the past few days.<br><br>( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ZirBy5J8g )<br><br>U have no idea how it feels to love a game with your soul and it be ripped from u needlessly just for asking questions and wondering why i nvr got answers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707579">Expand</a></span>

Every time I play this game it feels like something is lacking or that somethings are way out of place. The shooting is nice but the rest is very inconsistent. There are a lot of balance issues because of the premium stuff and the matchmaking is a bit weird...That&apos;s pretty much CrimeCraft in a nutshell: Inconsistent and weird...</span>
