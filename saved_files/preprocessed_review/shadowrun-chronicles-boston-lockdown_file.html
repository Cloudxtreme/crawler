When they were in alpha the game was so brutal it was unplayable for me for several months of the over 2 years of development time for this game. Eventually they came out with a beta where it seemed they were trying to keep their promises of fun character creation and the ability to not be locked into choices to be able to play anyway you wanted and experiment with everything. A month before release they removed it because reasons. Its not that they didn&apos;t have a winning formula they just did not like letting you play the game the way you wanted to. Then their was the lag that required server restarts all the time. They haven&apos;t fixed that completely but ti is much better, With the last update they decided to for the most part remove your ability to gain Karma because players who beat the game could not play the game without playing coop and still cant, which increased coop play and the ability to find groups, but without real Karma the gain the Devs kicked the player base in the balls once to often. Without reward their Iis no reason to play coop anymore to grind 1-3 karma for skills that keep costing more and currently cap at 26 Karma ie tier 10 which only works if you have that weapon equipped if its a passive ability. They&apos;ve padded the game to such extent that the grind is too brutal again. These devs obviously do not know what makes a successful shadowrun game fun for players. They know they can do anything they want they have my money and have reneged on their promises which you can see on kickstarter , unfortunately their actions are ruining the game they created and killing the online component which is necessary for the mid to high level missions, npcs wont cut it in high level solo play.... So until they release more storyline content their is no reason to play this game anymore. You just cant trust their decision making ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5248147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is a very simple move and attack game.  It IS fun to a degree to play with others, especially when someone flubs and makes a mistake.
<br>
<br>Since launch there has been game breaking lag in the game and multiple updates have not been able to fix it.  I have to say they pushed for a release date, yet we are honestly at this point paying to beta the game..
<br>
<br>The devs do communicate with the community VERY, VERY well.  They really seem eager to get things on track.  And I for one have faith.
<br>
<br>That being said, I unlike others, do not rate on hopes, dreams, and promise but on actuality.  If I did, I could easily give this game a 7.5+.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5228670">Expand</a></span>

The game that was originally promised is a far cry from what now exists. The dev team had some serious hiccups along the way and the game has been the victim.
<br>
<br>From the start you create your character. Let me say the diversity on offer is pretty weak. Those familiar with the setting will recognise the metatypes on offer but they make very little difference to your character barring a few stat ups and downs. What Cliffhanger have created rather than a vibrant array of characters is a &quot;Choose your own brown simulator&quot; all classes feel the same whether you are slinging spells or firing a gun it all feels the same.
<br>For experienced tabletop Shadowrun players those of you that love the build up to a job, the meat and potatoes of what makes the universe immersive and interesting, you will be sorely disappointed. There is nothing in the way of legwork, no stealth options, no casing. You go in; shoot, punch or blast anyone that gets in your way and that&apos;s about it.
<br>Voice acting is emotionless and inconsistent. Character advancement is a boring affair with linear trees and little variety.
<br>
<br>The mission variety is lacklustre and you will be grinding the same missions over and over to get the required XP to level up your (as previous mentioned, boring) skill trees.
<br>
<br>Server problems and lag have been an issue from the start.
<br>
<br>You may see a lot of positive reviews crop up, let it be known that Cliffhanger has filed for bankruptcy and their team has put out a request to fanboys to &quot;Go out and recruit anyone you can to support us&quot;
<br>
<br>I am of the personal belief that there are a lot of people here defending mediocrity simply because they have dropped a not insignificant amount of money on it and hate the idea that they may have bought a lemon.
<br>
<br>Suffice to say chummers, give this one a wide berth. If you haven&apos;t bought Shadowrun Returns, or Dragonfall yet I highly recommend you try them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5288839">Expand</a></span>

If you like the Shadowrun Setting.. go ahead. The runs are very interesting and the storyline will unfold slowly. You can also play in co-op with up to 4 buddies. This is the real tabletop feeling with firiend. Nicely done!</span>

Second, do not expect a great game experience, here is why:
<br>
<br>You will get a limited character skill set, a limited story line that is completely linear (and woe to you if one proves impossible to complete, because you are done), and a world experience that consists of five or six vendors and four quest givers.
<br>
<br>The online feature allows you to group but since it is unlikely your group members will be able to stay logged on that long, it is more a frustration than a useful feature.
<br>
<br>The entire game reminds one of a noob area rather than a finished game.  You get near the end (unless you have one of two builds you will not complete the series) and you think - this is it, I can now explore the world.  Only there is no rest of the world.  The one thing that keeps you away from this is that the final adventure is impossible - again unless you have one of two builds.
<br>
<br>Crashed mid game make you start to have many scenarios.
<br>
<br>The universe wants a Shadowrun MMO, but this is not it.  It is a turn based replay of the old Microsoft Shadowrun team shooter.
<br>
<br>Ignore the comments by others about lag and unreliability, except for crashes that knock your modem off line and take an hour to recover from, you won;t have lag and the game started reliable, and will be again.  The issue is the developers did not have the resources to make a compelling story or an interactive world.  In an age of sandboxes, handing someone two grains of sand for the price of Ipanema beach and then declaring that is the nature of beta is a poor market strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5248107">Expand</a></span>

<br>It totally is Shadowrun, it is fun to group with friends, setting, characters and graphics are awesome and what is really important for me when it comes to a great gaming experience:
<br>No gamebreaking bugs for me!
<br>Had some difficulties with the control of the camera, but, well if that&apos;s the only thing...
<br>Thumbs up!</span>

<br>
<br>So, first, let me address the lag. IT HAS BEEN RESOLVED. Like many games at launch, especially from small companies, Shadowrun Chronicles (SRC) had some problems. But one week and many patches later, the game is running smoothly. So I hope no one who takes the time to read this will condemn the game because others have claimed it is unplayable. Reviewers who rated the game low because of lag aren&apos;t really rating the game. Those reviews are knee-jerk reactions to what was, admittedly, quite horrible lag; but to actually rate the game fairly, it would make more sense to wait until the lag is fixed and then rate the game based on its actual quality. So I would not make a purchasing decision based on anyone who rated it poorly because of lag. If you do, you will be missing out on a very fun Shadowrun experience.
<br>
<br>Now about the game! It is like a cross between Shadowrun Returns (SRR) and XCOM. Fans of the PNP RPG might be disappointed in the character creation process as it is not a literal translation of those rules. At this time there are no traditional PNP attributes like strength, dexterity, etc. They are reflected instead in broader categories such as Body (which encompasses health, strength, and dexterity), which is labeled as a &quot;skill&quot; along with traditional skills such as Blades, Pistols, Automatics, etc. As you spend karma in a skill set (I&apos;ll use Body as an example) you have to make decisions at each purchasing point whether you want to increase your health or dexterity, dexterity or accuracy, health or reaction time, etc. I&apos;m not in love with this method, because I&apos;m one of those who would have preferred to see a literal translation of the PNP rules. However, I understand the realities of creating a game, and I understand that compromises have to be made based on aesthetics and resource limitations. Harebrained Schemes had a significantly larger budget to make every iteration of SRR, and even Jordan Weisman (the creator of the Shadowrun IP) decided to alter their approach in making SRR because the PC game version did not need all the elements of the PNP rules to be a good game. Cliffhanger has taken a similar approach with SRC, and while it might serve as a turn-off to diehard fans of the PNP game, frankly all those differences are forgotten once you start a mission. Once inside, one&apos;s only care is completing the run, getting out alive, and collecting that sweet karma and nuyen to prepare your character for the next run.
<br>
<br>I have not progressed far enough to know how long the initial campaign is, but I know Cliffhanger&apos;s vision for the game is to do much more with it. The online/coop nature of it lends itself to the possibility of frequent updates, so my *hope* is that new missions will be added on a regular basis rather than using the SRR model of spending a year or more to craft an entire campaign-type story before adding new content.
<br>
<br>Bottom line ... if you like turn-based tactical combat that&apos;s almost identical to XCOM, this is for you. Everything else is just icing on the cake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5237808">Expand</a></span>

A true beta and stress test were never done. They pushed this game to meat deadlines and empty budget with hopes that enough people would buy on the name alone to hopefully clean it up. To me that is not how sales and the seller/buyer relationship is supposed to be.
<br>
<br>Like many online games this one has a tremendous amount of bugs and lag. Again a beta could have helped smooth the launch.
<br>
<br>Lets assume you white knights have come to expect that. Accepting unpolished turds on release day. Ok.
<br>
<br>The game is very simplistic and limits are being put on classes because the devs cannot work around the abilities. For balance issues some classes get to be 1/2 what they are supposed to be depending on a group setup.
<br>
<br>The chat and UI are abyssmal.
<br>
<br>There is a certain amount of simplistic fun to the game. However, it should be a $3.99 app on tablets and phones. If I remember correctly the devs even stated they were designing it to be multiplatform and at the time many players were indeed upset as they knew without a doubt that would indeed dummy it down. Well the game is dummied and would easily be played on a tablet.
<br>
<br>In no world should this game be $40+. Such a price grab it is scary. $14.99 basic and $19.99 is more realistic for this release and even that is being most favourable. TO be honest, after playing this, if I could change things I would do without it at all. I am pretty sure they would have to pay me $12 an hour to play it and beta it for them as it is.
<br>
<br>These rating of 8+ REALLY are fanbois of the Shadowrun franchise and white knights hoping to take your money and advance this drek because the fell for it already.
<br>
<br>I can fault them for that in a way. As Shadowrun is AWESOME! It is hard for anything with Shadowrun in its name to be bad. But these guys did it. In that, they succeeded!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5226274">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is not any true to Shadowrun PnP, let&apos;s be honest, its very generic.
<br>The good is, at least the developers hear the community and looks like they pretend to convert the current game into a more true to 5th edition pnp product. We hope so.</span>

<br>Sure, it could be a fun little tactical game, but what would it actually have to do with the Patrician series? Where would the setting up of trade routes be, the politics, the complex economy - the actual depth of the game that people have come to expect?
<br>It&apos;s the same with SR Chronicles. This game format is okay - not good, but okay - for Jagged Alliance, but it&apos;s deeply disappointing for Shadowrun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-chronicles-boston-lockdown/user-reviews?user_review_id=7381589">Expand</a></span>
