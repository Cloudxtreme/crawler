<br>
<br>I had a bad PC . Therefore , I was looking for a game that could run in that PC and I found &quot;Sniper Art of Victory&quot;. I didn&#xB4;t pay attention to the reviews that were Mostly Negative.
<br>
<br>The first and second missions were not bad at all , I enjoyed it .
<br>
<br>After some minutes playing the things went bad , the missions were VERY DIFFICULT because the AI  detected you 150m away even if you are hidden. The AI was impossible to kill at the first time because they just prefired you.
<br>
<br>I also found A LOT of bugs in this game and some things that were stupid like picking up a MP40 from an enemy that didn&#xB4;t shoot you that has 4 BULLETS and the other enemies having a lot of bullets.
<br>
<br>The hitboxes are AWFUL , I shot at the enemy with the white circle right in their heads and the bullet just goes through them without killing.
<br>
<br>Seriously , don&#xB4;t waste money in this game that seems more like a mobile game with no sense , OP AI , small hitboxes and a LOT OF BUGS.
<br>
<br>Pay attention to reviews , don&#xB4;t be like me :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-art-of-victory/user-reviews?user_review_id=7492773">Expand</a></span>
