Or just the one giant robot whos a bit harder. Or escort some people while fending off some more giant robots. Or fly/drive around smashing into glowing objective markers. That basically sums up the whole campaign, which revolves around the aforementioned missions. The good bits from the first game, like the freeroam and destruction, are gone, replaced with boring level design coupled with almost no destruction. Shooting is twitchy, due to the fact that you have to hold down the &apos;pull out gun&apos; control then fire, and melee isn&apos;t all that fun. Transforming is great and all and the driving has greatly improved from the last game, there is no longer the nitro and drift and jump mechanics that made it feel like a driving game (a poorly designed one, however). Now, transforming is simply sprinting, which is a good thing as theres not so many details that the design team didn&apos;t have enough time to make it.
<br>Multiplayer is sub-par, with a decent mathcmaker but only 4v4 matches. There is no progression and some characters are too powerful, though all feel the same in terms of handling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen/user-reviews?user_review_id=1703803">Expand</a></span>

First it was loosely installed within my computer, possibly because of the lack of updates and patches those **** forgot to make. Not only that; the multiplayer servers are empty and disorganized, the campaign is too repetitive and monotonous etc. This is a game you would definitely love to miss.</span>

For a plot, it loosely follows the movie with a couple random never before seen transforms thrown in for no apparent reason. It gets repetitive quick. Controls are terrible, you have to hold a button down to go into vehicle mode and keep it held the entire time... that is a pain in the ass. The game lacks a definite customization choice in the control outcomes that make the game itself ludacris to play. Lots of technical issues, graphics are only sub-par and should be far better, not very much is destructible in the environment. I want a transformers game with at least Crysis like graphics and where you get to truly destroy things, not just fences and lightpoles. The weapon array is weak, you only get your primary and secondary weapons, a special attack, and mele. This game lacks way too much to be a good game, instead its either completely average or below. Too many issues hold it back, when you think your having fun, you snap back into reality and realize your not. At least I got this for $30, and not $60 like the ps3 version i was considering getting, instead got pc for lan... which it doesn&apos;t have.

However, the single player is really bad, i mean there are not a lot of actions and every mission is the same. There are no allies you can rely on. All you do is shoot and run and shoot and run.</span>
